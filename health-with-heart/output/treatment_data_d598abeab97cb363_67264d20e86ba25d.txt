Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal 27ng/ml. Please continue supplementing with vit D3 (increase to 2/3 sprays) & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
2. Slightly raised liver enzymes - can be a side effect of aspavor. Your cholesterol is well controlled so consider reducing aspavor dosage. Milk thistle and coQ10 can also help.
3. hsCRP is a marker of inflammation. Your level puts you in the average risk range for heart disease.
4. Your insulin level is normal but above optimal. Optimal would be 5 or less. Try to reduce sugar and refined carbs in your diet, slowly build up your exercise again and try to lose a bit of weight.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Mpho you report very high stress levels (work related) which you quite rightly think may be influencing your overall health. You have recently resigned so I hope that you have some time to rest and reflect and improve your health. Your blood results were actually fairly good in general but you are on a fair amount of chronic medication. I would encourage you to try and lose some weight, slowly get back into your cycling and enjoy some time off from work.
