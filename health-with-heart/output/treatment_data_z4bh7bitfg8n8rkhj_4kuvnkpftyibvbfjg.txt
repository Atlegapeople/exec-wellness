Comment Value: Cassim it was a pleasure to do your medical today. You currently seem to be in very good health. You do have a strong family history of heart disease and diabetes but through your lifestyle, diet and exercise you seem to be doing a good job of avoiding going down the same path healthwise. However as mentioned, your waist circumference is slightly higher than we would like to see it so I encourage you to keep an eye on it and try and reduce it to below 94cm.

Comment Value: Cassim, you currently seem to be in good health. You do have a strong family history of heart disease and diabetes but through your lifestyle, diet and exercise you seem to be doing a good job of avoiding going down the same path healthwise. However as mentioned, your waist circumference is slightly higher than we would like to see it so I encourage you to keep an eye on it and try and reduce it to below 94cm and watch your diet a bit better. Stress management also plays a significant role in maintaining health so I encourage you to give this area some attention! It was a pleasure to do your medical today and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
Special Investigation Notes: No red flags on investigations. Heart Rate Monitor reported to read very low but asymptomatic.

Comment Value: Cassim, you currently seem to be in good health. You do have a strong family history of heart disease and diabetes but through your lifestyle, diet and exercise you seem to be doing a good job of avoiding going down the same path healthwise. However as mentioned, your waist circumference is slightly higher than we would like to see it so I encourage you to keep an eye on it and try and reduce it to below 94cm and watch your diet a bit better. Stress management also plays a significant role in maintaining health so I encourage you to give this area some attention! It was a pleasure to do your medical today and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
Special Investigation Notes: No red flags on investigations. Heart Rate Monitor reported to read very low but asymptomatic.
