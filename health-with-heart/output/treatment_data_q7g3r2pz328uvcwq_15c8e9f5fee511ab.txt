Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1.Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 27ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 4000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Slightly raised liver enzyme - may be associated with insulin resistance and a "fatty liver". Watch the carbs/sugar in your diet and try to lose cm's around your waist.
3. Slightly raised total/LDL cholesterol. Try to improve your diet and exercise levels. Supplementing with omega 3 can also help.
4. HcCRP level shows high levels of inflammation which could be due to high insulin levels, autoimmunity (Hashimoto's) or underlying infection. Please recheck the level.
5. High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. Try to eliminate all sugars/refined carbs and exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 x a week. Repeat in Jan.
6. Your TSH suggests that the dosage of euthyrox is too high. Please reduce to 50ug & follow up with your endo.
