Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D levels are low. Supplement for at least 3months and review with your doctor.
2. Decreased kidney filtration rate in this case most likely due to being fasting on the day for tests.  Review when you are not fasting with the next opportunity.
3. Increased liver enzymes likely due to a fatty liver. Maintain your new lifestyle changes and loose cm around your waistline.
4. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol mildly raised.  This will improve over the next few months. Review fasting with a doctor in 6 months.
5. Mild - moderately raised background inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Review in 6months after a sustained change in your lifestyle.

Comment Value: Cassim, you currently seem to be in good health. You do have a strong family history of heart disease and diabetes but through your lifestyle, diet and exercise you seem to be doing a good job of avoiding going down the same path healthwise. However as mentioned, your waist circumference is slightly higher than we would like to see it so I encourage you to keep an eye on it and try and reduce it to below 94cm and watch your diet a bit better. Stress management also plays a significant role in maintaining health so I encourage you to give this area some attention! It was a pleasure to do your medical today and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
