MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Palesa Gamede
Report Date: 2023-09-14
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: You examined generally well with no current clinical concerns. Regular breast self-examinations are recommended. If you notice any irregularities to consult your doctor. Both ears had no clinical abnormalities with good hearing.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular Pap smear screening helps detect any abnormalities early & improves management outcomes. You can book an appointment with your GP or Gynae. Mammogram screening also becomes important as you get older (>40 years).
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good current baseline. There are a few lifestyle aspects that we can optimise in order to prevent future health problems. 

A good nutritious balanced diet (with reduced sugar and increased vegetable variety) has many benefits. This together with more regular exercise should help manage stress levels during busy seasons. 

We can follow you up for a routine screening Pap Smear at the practice. 

Building these good habits takes time - but is so worth it. Keep going!

Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: You examined generally well with no current clinical concerns. Regular breast self-examinations are recommended. If you notice any irregularities to consult your doctor. Both ears had no clinical abnormalities with good hearing.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular Pap smear screening helps detect any abnormalities early & improves management outcomes. You can book an appointment with your GP or Gynae. Mammogram screening also becomes important as you get older (>40 years).
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good current baseline. There are a few lifestyle aspects that we can optimise in order to prevent future health problems. 

A good nutritious balanced diet (with reduced sugar and increased vegetable variety) has many benefits. This together with more regular exercise should help manage stress levels during busy seasons. 

We can follow you up for a routine screening Pap Smear at the practice. 

Building these good habits takes time - but is so worth it. Keep going!
