Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Total cholesterol marginally high but not clinically concerning as your LDL is within normal and your HDL is a nice high level.
2. Low vitamin D level. Supplement with vitamin D3 5000iu daily and recheck level in 4 months aiming for 50 to 80ng/dl.
3. UsCRP is an inflammatory marker - your level puts you in the average risk category in terms of heart disease. 
4. Your adrenal response - cortisol level (stress hormone) on the high side and DHEA being low, suggests that you are quite stressed. Consider mindfulness and seeing Melissa. Adaptogens like ashwagandha can also help.
