Overview Notes: As discussed a standard cholesterol panel does not give us enough information to stratify risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol is mildly raised but your inflammation levels are nice and low so you are probably not at high risk. By increasing your exercise, improving your diet and decreasing stress and alcohol you should manage to bring it down.

Comment Value: I think the main health challenge you are facing at the moment is a very high level of stress. This is impacting negatively on your lifestyle, with no exercise, poor dietary choices, increasing alcohol consumption and occasional migraines. I hope that your current situation will change but in the meantime I encourage you to manage the stress better through a healthy diet, exercise, time spent breathing deeply or meditating and finding joy outside of work.

Overview Notes: Stress is not something to be ignored. It has a huge physical impact on the body. It is most likely the cause of your migraines and slightly raised BP. Whilst it is difficult to avoid given your work situation it can be managed better through exercise, breathing and meditation and taking time to do things that you enjoy.

Overview Notes: As discussed a standard cholesterol panel does not give us enough information to stratify risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol is mildly raised but your inflammation levels are nice and low so you are probably not at high risk. By increasing your exercise, improving your diet and decreasing stress and alcohol you should manage to bring it down.

Overview Notes: As discussed a standard cholesterol panel does not give us enough information to stratify risk of heart disease. Your cholesterol is mildly raised but your inflammation levels are nice and low so you are probably not at high risk. By increasing your exercise, improving your diet and decreasing stress and alcohol you should manage to bring it down.

Your cholesterol is mildly raised but your inflammation levels are nice and low so you are probably not at high risk. By increasing your exercise, improving your diet and decreasing stress and alcohol you should manage to bring it down.
