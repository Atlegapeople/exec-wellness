Overview Notes: Try to reduce your waist circumference and BMI. We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.

Comment Value: Mark you mentioned big life decisions causing some recent stress. Despite this your overall chronic health is improving and you have been resilient as evident by your energy and gratitude for life. Your blood pressure is normal and you are not diabetic or insulin resistant. Your Hs-CRP (signifying background levels of inflammation) is low but your homocysteine is on the high side and you should consider taking MethylCare. Addressing diet has lowered your total cholesterol from the previous fasting lipogram test. Add more exercise back in to your routine and your total cholesterol should improve to near normal. A main concern is that your TSH was suggesting abnormal thyroid functions. We should monitor this for you in one month. It was a pleasure doing your medical today and look forward to seeing you again next year.
