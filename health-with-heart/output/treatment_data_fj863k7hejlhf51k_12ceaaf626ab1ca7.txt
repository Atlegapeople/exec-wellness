Overview Notes: Dear Liesha, thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen. There are no major red flags that need to be addressed immediately, but I would advise that your liver function tests be monitored again. Add the fasting insulin if you have managed some lifestyle changes. Lifestyle change can take a good 3-6 months to improve health. Repeat the other tests that were abnormal after this time frame to review. It was a pleasure giving you feedback for your comprehensive medical! Dr Janine
