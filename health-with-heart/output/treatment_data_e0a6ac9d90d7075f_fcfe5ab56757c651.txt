Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your deficient Vitamin D levels can be supplemented & blood tests repeated in 3/12. There were a few raised markers that show potential health risk. Your cholesterol was raised. Your fasting insulin was high. This shows your body struggling to process your blood glucose levels. It puts you are risk of developing diabetes at a young age. Your urate was higher than it should be. This is often seen in high red meat consumption. There were raised markers of low grade inflammation (hsCRP). All these can be managed and reduced with lifestyle adjustments & weight loss (it can make a big difference!). However we will need to monitor and potentially start medical treatment if not controlled.
