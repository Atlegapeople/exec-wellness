Report Date: 2022-08-31
Doctor: Melinda Whitfield
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Clinical examination on the day was normal.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a gynaecologists for a Pap smear
Overview Notes: Ancois, you are generally in good health but there are tweaks to optimise you to even better health. I think you need the stress supplements mentioned (Ashwaghanda and Theanine), Vit D (5000iu once daily) as well as a good Omega 3 (for cholesterol) and daily Magnesium (for sleep). We also discussed inserting a Mirena for which I'll send you scripts and forms. Hope you had a restorative time in Austria!

Comment Value: Cholesterol a little high - please watch animal fats. Insulin could be better - consider seeing a dietician and cutting back on carbs and sugars. Cortisol too low - looks burnt out. Rest in Austria please! Recommend Ashwaghandha & Theanine supplements. Also need sleep & Vit D!

Employee: Ancois Winsauer
Report Date: 2022-08-31
Doctor: Melinda Whitfield
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Clinical examination on the day was normal.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a gynaecologists for a Pap smear
Overview Notes: Ancois, you are generally in good health but there are tweaks to optimise you to even better health. I think you need the stress supplements mentioned (Ashwaghanda and Theanine), Vit D (5000iu once daily) as well as a good Omega 3 (for cholesterol) and daily Magnesium (for sleep). We also discussed inserting a Mirena for which I'll send you scripts and forms. Hope you had a restorative time in Austria!
Comment Key: VitalsRecommendation
Comment Value: Don't read into the high risk for the WHtR. An increased wait circumference incr one's risk for chronic disease but yours is marginal. Improving Insulin levels will help this. Cutting out carbs or trying intermittent fasting helps. We can discuss this in a teleconsult?
Special Investigation Notes: None
