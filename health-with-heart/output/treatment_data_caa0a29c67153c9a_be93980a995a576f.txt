Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: The biggest red flag here is your inflammatory marker being so high. This is likely related to the weight that you are carrying and your lack of exercise, but could also be a hang over from your recent infection. Please repeat in 4 weeks time.
Your vitamin D is low and should be supplemented with 5000iu daily. Vitamin D is essential for many metabolic processes as well as healthy bones as we age. Repeat levels in 3/12.
As discussed the triglycerides in your cholesterol profile will likely come down with lifestyle change. These are small sticky particles that we want to be low. 
Your adrenal function is congruent with your feeling very burnt out and depleted. This is an invitation to rest, restore and replenish!
