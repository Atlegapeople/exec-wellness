Comment Value: 1. Deficient Vitamin D levels. Supplement for 3 months and review with a doctor.
2. Your total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides are very raised. Lifestyle changes are always very important to help bring this down but we have started medication for this.  Review with a repeat fasting test in 3 - 6 months.
3. Raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Stop smoking and reduce daily sugar to improve this.
4. A raised fasting insulin can be a warning signal for diabetes. Make sure you get enough exercise and eat a healthy, clean and balanced diet.  Review in 3 -6 months.
