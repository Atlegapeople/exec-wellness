Comment Value: Rochelle you have many significant issues that have put strain on you, your family and your work however you maintain a positive outlook and I respect that. I highly recommend that you chat to a genetic counsellor (Prof Krause at Donald Gordon) about your genetic risk for Motor Neuron Disease. This will help you to decide if you want to do the genetic tests or not. It will also help you manage the fear of the unknown. I also recommend that you see a physio urgently to work on your musculoskeletal health and work towards better mobility. A biokinetisist may also be needed, but the physio can comment on that. Melissa De Waard can offer psychological counselling (ICAS can pay for this) and I highly recommend you speak to her to help you to manage all your trauma, stress and pressures. Carry on with your healthy diet. For your High homocysteine levels and borderline vitamin D levels I recommend phytomulti 2 tabs a day and for the inflammation in your muscles and back omega 3 two tablets a day.
Your DHEA levels are a bit low and you might be heading towards burn out, so DHEA 10mg can help manage this.
I have prescribed circadian 4mg nocte for you to help you to fall asleep at night.
I also gave you Tramadol 100mg and stemitil 10mg IMI STAT for your pending migraine today.
Remember health has many layers, look after yourself, invest in you psychological and emotional well being and please don't ignore you back pain any longer. You matter and you need to seek help!
Lastly if time with the physio, the psychologist and the supplements don't help the muscle pain, stiff thumbs and headaches I think a neurologist consult might be indicated. For that reason please check in with us or your GP regularly to monitor your progress with this in the back of your mind.
I wish you all the health and happiness you deserve.

Melissa De Waard can offer psychological counselling (ICAS can pay for this) and I highly recommend you speak to her to help you to manage all your trauma, stress and pressures. Carry on with your healthy diet. For your High homocysteine levels and borderline vitamin D levels I recommend phytomulti 2 tabs a day and for the inflammation in your muscles and back omega 3 two tablets a day.
Your DHEA levels are a bit low and you might be heading towards burn out, so DHEA 10mg can help manage this.
I have prescribed circadian 4mg nocte for you to help you to fall asleep at night.
I also gave you Tramadol 100mg and stemitil 10mg IMI STAT for your pending migraine today.
Remember health has many layers, look after yourself, invest in you psychological and emotional well being and please don't ignore you back pain any longer. You matter and you need to seek help!
Lastly if time with the physio, the psychologist and the supplements don't help the muscle pain, stiff thumbs and headaches I think a neurologist consult might be indicated. For that reason please check in with us or your GP regularly to monitor your progress with this in the back of your mind.
I wish you all the health and happiness you deserve.

Comment Value: Rochelle you have many significant issues that have put strain on you, your family and your work however you maintain a positive outlook and I respect that. I highly recommend that you chat to a genetic counsellor (Prof Krause at Donald Gordon) about your genetic risk for Motor Neuron Disease. This will help you to decide if you want to do the genetic tests or not. It will also help you manage the fear of the unknown. I also recommend that you see a physio urgently to work on your musculoskeletal health and work towards better mobility. A biokinetisist may also be needed, but the physio can comment on that.
