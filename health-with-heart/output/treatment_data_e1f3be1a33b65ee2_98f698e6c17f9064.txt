Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High ESR and hsCRP levels - may indicate underlying infection/inflammation when bloods were done. Please repeat in 3 weeks.
2. Your vitamin D level has improved but it is still suboptimal so I recommend you continue supplementation until you reach a level of 50ng/ml.
3. Reduced kidney function. You mention a recent half marathon with possible dehydration. Please repeat test and ensure good hydration. Avoid anti inflammatories.
4.  Mildly increased total/LDL cholesterol. Watch the animal fat in your diet, continue to exercise and monitor it annually. Omega 3, niacin and rhychol may also help.
5.Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 11umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. e.g. Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
