Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly raised liver enzymes - can be an indication of "non alcoholic fatty liver disease" which means there is a fatty infiltrate into the liver. Try to lose weight especially abdominal fat through a healthy low carb, low sugar diet and continue to exercise. Repeat the level in 3 to 4 months and if it remains high then I recommend an abdominal ultrasound.
2. Above optimal homocysteine levels - can be optimised by taking "activated" B vitamins in a good quality multivitamin like phytomulti from metagenics
3. Suboptimal vitamin D level - consider spending some time in the sun without getting sunburnt or supplementing with 2000 to 4000iu of vitamin D3 daily.
