Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is low at  17ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone & immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Full blood count showed a macrocytosis picture - suggest a B12, folate and iron store level to exclude those as causes
-  Limit saturated & trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods and replacing all refined carbs with those high in fibre. Repeat lipogram in 3 months.
