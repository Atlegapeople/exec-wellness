Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal at 23.8ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml.
- Uric acid is raised: reduce consumption of purine rich foods (red or organ meats, shellfish, legumes), avoid sugar & drink more water.
- Your “good” cholesterol - HDL - is low. Increase with frequent exercise & eating health fats (omega 3 fatty acids from oily fish such as sardines, pilchards and mackerel as well as flaxseed oil). Eating more calories than you burn, particularly from high-carbohydrate foods increases your triglycerides. Lower by exercising regularly & avoiding refined carbohydrates. Supplement with Rychol.
- Raised fasting glucose & insulin indicate insulin resistance. Reduce your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet and incorporate regular exercise (at least 3-5 times a week for 30-60 minutes). Insumax-Q may assist with glucose metabolism. Repeat in 6 weeks.
