MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Elzette Young
Report Date: 2023-09-14
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You examine clinically well. Your BMI and body fat % were both raised. But with the lifestyle adjustments we discussed this can be reduced. Regular breast examinations are important - it’s great to hear that your Gynae checks at each visit!
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular Pap smear screening is important to detect any irregularities early. That is great news that your last results were normal and that you regularly attend your Gynae.
Overview Notes: There were a few areas that we identified for optimising. Forming a good exercise routine, eating a nutritious diet and avoiding substances (vaping) will all have a positive impact. This is not only on your current wellbeing but also your long term health. Making these changes can be challenging - but worth it in the long run.

We are here to help improve your health in whatever way we can. I hope you have a restful leave coming up and return to work feeling refreshed!

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your total cholesterol was slightly raised. Lifestyle adjustments (diet and exercise) can lower this level. We will monitor and repeat blood tests in 4-6 months. Your hsCRP (low grade inflammation marker) was also raised. This is possible due to a subclinical infection at the time your bloods were taken. We can repeat this marker on your next test to ensure it has corrected.
