Comment Value: 1. The full blood count indicated you still have a mild anaemia. Continue on Ferrimed as prescribed by your GP and follow up with your GP for repeat testing in 3 months. The ESR was high which may indicate an underlying inflammation or infection. 
2. Low Vitamin D levels at 19 ng/ml. Optimal Vit D levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Supplement with 50 000 IU Vit D3 weekly for at least 3 months. Levels can be repeated after this period.
3. HS CRP (a marker of inflammation) was high. Inflammation can have multiple causes eg. infection, auto-immune disease, poor diet and lack of exercise. 
4. Cortisol is low and may be due to recent corticosteroid use or other factors. You have been on cortisone recently which is likely the cause of the low cortisol. Repeat testing in 8 weeks is advised.
