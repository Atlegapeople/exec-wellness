Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1.Vit D level is suboptimal at 23.9ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 2000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Reduced kidney function. May be due to overuse of anti inflammatories. Please avoid these & repeat kidney function.
3. Raised GGT liver enzyme - may be due to a fatty liver. Try to lose cm's around waist & take glutathione/milk thistle.
4. High cholesterol & triglycerides. Improve diet & exercise, lose weight. Rychol, niacin & omega 3 may help. If not coming down consider starting a statin.
5. Very high inflammation (hsCRP) however you were sick when bloods were done therefore I suggest repeating.
6. Your homocysteine is above optimal at 12umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. e.g Metagenics MethylCare. Recheck level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l. 
7. Fasting insulin at upper limit of normal. Increase exercise & reduce all carbs/sugar/processed food.
