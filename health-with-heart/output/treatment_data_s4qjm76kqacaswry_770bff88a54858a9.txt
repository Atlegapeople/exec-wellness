Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Kidney function was slightly reduced: likely due to dehydration. Repeat test in 2-3months (when you are well hydrated) is advised.
2. Liver enzymes raised. This may be due to several factors including alcohol, medication, toxins or infection. Limit alcohol consumption and repeat the test in 2 months.
3. The Vitamin D level is low at 18 ng/ml. Optimal levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Supplement with 50 000IU Vit D3 weekly for 3 months and increase intake of Vit D rich foods eg oily fish. Levels can be repeated after this period.
4. High cholesterol. This can reduce by limiting refined carbs/sugar, trans fats and animal product consumption, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. Please consider seeing a Dietician. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
5. Fasting insulin levels are very high. This means you are insulin resistant (a precursor for Diabetes).  This is still reversible!
