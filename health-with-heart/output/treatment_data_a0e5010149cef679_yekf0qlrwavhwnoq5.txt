Comment Value: Gert it was a pleasure to do your medical again today. I last saw you nearly two years ago and since then not too much has changed. You remain fit and healthy, having recovered from a serious covid infection in June last year.  The only concern today was your raised homocysteine level. I suggest you supplement with B vitamins as discussed to bring this level down. Please pay attention to your stress levels and ways to reduce this. We wish you a happy and healthy year ahead!

Comment Value: Gert it was a pleasure to do your medical again today. I last saw you nearly two years ago and since then not too much has changed. You remain fit and healthy, having recovered from a serious covid infection in June last year.  The only concern today was your raised homocysteine level. I suggest you supplement with B vitamins as discussed to bring this level down. Please pay attention to your stress levels and ways to reduce this. We wish you a happy and healthy year ahead!
