MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Dale Rimmington
Report Date: 2025-07-28
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Your blood pressure was elevated on multiple readings, including those done by your sister and the biokineticist. We discussed increasing your medication for better control. Your BMI and Body Fat % are also raised, which can improve with lifestyle changes.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: I’m really glad you were able to attend this medical, as it helped us identify a few important health concerns that may not have been otherwise detected. These findings will need to be managed going forward, and as we discussed, this often requires a combination of lifestyle changes and, where appropriate, medication.

Our aim with these steps is to improve your current health and reduce the risk of future cardiovascular complications. Ongoing monitoring over the next few months will be important to assess progress and guide any adjustments needed.

Once you’ve seen the specialist, I’ll be happy to review their feedback with you and refine your management plan as needed. In the meantime, continuing to focus on the recommended lifestyle strategies will be a valuable step toward protecting your long-term health.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Clinical Recommendations: Your blood pressure was elevated on multiple readings, including those done by your sister and the biokineticist. We discussed increasing your medication for better control. Your BMI and Body Fat % are also raised, which can improve with lifestyle changes.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: I’m really glad you were able to attend this medical, as it helped us identify a few important health concerns that may not have been otherwise detected. These findings will need to be managed going forward, and as we discussed, this often requires a combination of lifestyle changes and, where appropriate, medication.

Our aim with these steps is to improve your current health and reduce the risk of future cardiovascular complications. Ongoing monitoring over the next few months will be important to assess progress and guide any adjustments needed.

Once you’ve seen the specialist, I’ll be happy to review their feedback with you and refine your management plan as needed. In the meantime, continuing to focus on the recommended lifestyle strategies will be a valuable step toward protecting your long-term health.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen
