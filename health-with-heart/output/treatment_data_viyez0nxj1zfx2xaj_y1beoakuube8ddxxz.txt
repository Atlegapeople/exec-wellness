Comment Value: You are currently healthy but do have some significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease including family history, an increased BMI and waist circumference. However I am confident that this risk can be mitigated through your lifestyle. Pay particular attention to your nutrition, lose some weight, continue exercising regularly and reduce your stress and anxiety levels as best you can. Your current cardiovascular risk score is low, which is great so our aim is to keep it that way!
