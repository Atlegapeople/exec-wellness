Comment Value: 1. Your one raised liver enzyme is most likely due to fat infiltration in to the liver.  This will improve as your lifestyle changes start to translate into weight loss.
2. Your uric acid is just borderline.  Decrease red meat to 1-2x a week and limit alcohol.  Maintain good hydration.
3. Your LDL cholesterol is mildly raised.  This will improve with exercise and a healthy diet.
4. A high ultra-sensitive CRP indicates ongoing levels of inflammation due to a poor lifestyle and chronic illness. It will improve as you exercise, eat well and manage to improve quality of sleep.  Unchecked stress also plays a big role in this. 
5. A very raised fasting insulin means you are very close to becoming Diabetic but you can still turn this around!
