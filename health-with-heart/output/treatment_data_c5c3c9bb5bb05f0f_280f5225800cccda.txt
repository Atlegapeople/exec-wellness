Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your kidney filtration rate is lower than expected, this may not necessarily be abnormal.  Repeat a kidney function test when well hydrated in 2-3 months with your doctor to monitor.
2. Your one liver enzyme is very mildly elevated (you report this was investigated before). Keep monitoring this test every 6- 12 months, sooner if you feel persistently unwell.
3. Mildly raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP.  Stress, poor sleep and daily sugar can affect this.  The rest of your lifestyle is good.
4. Mildly raised homocysteine, this carries a cardiovascular risk. Reduce this with methylated B vitamins and maintain a good vegetable intake.
