Comment Value: 1. Low vitamin D level - supplement with vitamin D3 5000iu daily for 4 months & recheck level aiming for 50 to 80 ng/ml.
2. Slightly reduced kidney function. Ensure adequate hydration & retest level in 3 months.
3. Raised liver enzymes - probably due to "fatty liver". Watch alcohol consumption & try to lose weight around your abdomen. Milk thistle & glutathione supplements may help.
4. High cholesterol levels - watch diet & start exercising again.
5. High homocysteine levels. Supplement with activated/methylated B vitamins to reduce e.g. methylcare or neuroXcel.

Overview Notes: 6. Low testosterone levels. Fat around the abdomen may convert testosterone to oestrogen. Try to lose weight & build muscle. 
Reo having a young child and working definitely affects the amount of time we have to care for ourselves however I would encourage you to try to find time for exercise and to improve your diet. Please repeat some bloods in Dec/Jan & then follow up. I wish you a happy & healthy year further.
Comment Key: VitalsRecommendation
Comment Value: Monitor BP and if it remains elevated please book an appointment. A waist to height ratio of more than 50% is associated with a significantly increased risk for chronic disease and adverse cardiovascular events.
