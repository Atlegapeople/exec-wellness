Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram
Overview Notes: Dear Abieda thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen.
Positives were that you do not use excessive alcohol and that you are a resilient lady using stress as a positive motivator in your everyday life.  
Life style changes will be important in decreasing your levels of ongoing background inflammation.  This is in turn keeps your risk of future heart attacks and strokes as low as possible.
On a last note, lifestyle changes take a good 3-6 months to show change. I recommend repeating the tests that were abnormal after this time frame to review. It was a pleasure giving you feedback for your comprehensive medical! Dr Janine

Comment Value: Your lung function capacity is decreased compared to the expected normal value for someone with a similar weight and height.  The pattern of your result is synonymous with lung damage due to smoking.  You can still decrease this progression to full emphysema/COPD by stopping smoking.

Comment Value: Carrying weight around the abdominal area has been shown to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in men and women. Put simply, it is more important, especially for cardio-metabolic conditions, that your belt notch goes down than the reading on the scales.
