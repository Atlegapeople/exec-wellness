Comment Value: 1. The Haemoglobin, Red Cell Count, Haematocrit and MCH (Mean Cell Haemoglobin) levels are all decreased. This indicates you have Anaemia.
2. The ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) was elevated at 60 mm/hr. It may be due to several factors like inflammation, infection or auto-immune disease.
3. Vitamin D levels were decreased at 14.6 ng/ml; The normal ranges are between 50-60ng/ml.  Increase your consumption of Vitamin D rich food and take a good supplement.
4. The HDL cholesterol was low (1 mmol/L). This can be improved by eating more fibre, limiting saturated fats and frequent exercise.
5. HS CRP was elevated at 4 mg/ml.  This is a marker of inflammation with multiple possible causes.
Please consult your Doctor for further evaluation of the abovementioned abnormalities.
