Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Vitamin D only slightly improved since starting your supplement - keep taking it for a good 3 - 6months and review with your doctor.
2. Incorporate healthy fats (Avo, nuts, olive oil) to increase the protective HDL cholesterol.
3. Raised inflammation on your ultra-sensitive CRP. Allergies and chronic illness can contribute to this but a wide variety of veggies and managing stress will help decrease this for you.
4. A good fasting glucose and HBA1c for Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.
