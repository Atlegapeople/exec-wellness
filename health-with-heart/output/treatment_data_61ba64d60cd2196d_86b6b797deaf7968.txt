MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Douw Donald
Report Date: 2023-06-27
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Devinia Carelse
Clinical Recommendations: You are carrying a lot of excess weight and your body is taking strain. Sustainably loosing weight (diet/ exercise) will greatly benefit not only your joints, general mood, hormone levels but also your chronic conditions. Preventing complications and future cardiovascular events.
Men's Health Recommendations: There is a family history of Prostate Cancer (father). Regular screening can help early detection & management of any abnormalities (greatly improves outcomes). Your PSA level (blood marker) was normal. I would recommend a regular clinical prostate examination & repeated blood levels.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: There were a few areas that we marked as putting you at high risk for poor health outcomes & complications. A combination of lifestyle adjustments, weight loss & medication can reduce this risk. It is a tough journey to make these changes sustainably & you will need support - from healthcare workers as well as family/ friends. 

We are here to help you along the way. To assess the different management options at each stage.

Have a restful holiday & we will see you in the new year. 

Warm regards, 
Dr Jessica Koen

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: There were many red flags on your blood results. Your body is starting to take strain and is no longer functioning adequately. There were features of pre-diabetes, low grade inflammation, high urate (associated with gout), possible renal impairment, liver damage, low testosterone and low Vitamin D. These put you at high risk for poor outcomes. We can work at making changes to improve this damage (weight loss, improved diet, reduced sugar/ alcohol/ processed foods). It’s a hard process to make these changes - but it can be really impactful and beneficial to your health. We will follow-up management with you at the practice. Step by step we can work at improving your health.

Comment Value: I am glad to hear that you follow up with your Cardiologist. A GP can also form part of your chronic follow-up. Regular repeated blood work and clinical review are important - to prevent the complications associated with high blood pressure, cholesterol and extra weight gain.
