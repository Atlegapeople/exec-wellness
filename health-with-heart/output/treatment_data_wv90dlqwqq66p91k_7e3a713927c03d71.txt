Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Deficient Vitamin D levels. Supplement for 3 months and review with your doctor.
2. Increased liver enzyme (GGT) can in part be due to your Acriptega (this is usually not a harmful increase), but mostly due to excessive alcohol.  Reduce your alcohol when you have a drink.
3. Raised total cholesterol and LDL ("bad") cholesterol. Increase your vegetable intake and avoid too much restaurant food, fatty red meat and refined carbohydrates.
4. Raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. This will improve with anti-oxidant rich veggies and when more time has passed since stopping smoking.
5. A raised homocysteine increases your cardiovascular risk. Eat vegetables rich in B-vitamins.
