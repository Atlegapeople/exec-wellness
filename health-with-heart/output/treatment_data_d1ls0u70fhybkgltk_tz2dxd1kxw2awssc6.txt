Comment Value: Charlotte, it was a pleasure to meet you. I hope that I helped  highlight some health priorities for you. You know that a better way of life is achievable as you have done it before. I would encourage you to remember that you are a worthwhile investment and you deserve the vitality that will come from weight loss, healthier eating and physical activity. You are on target for your high cholesterol treatment. Well done! Keep monitoring your blood pressure and get it down to a target of 130/80 to start with. Aim to loose 10 % of your body weight and you'll enjoy a 50% reduction in risk of diabetes and other chronic illness, including cancer. I wish you all the best!
