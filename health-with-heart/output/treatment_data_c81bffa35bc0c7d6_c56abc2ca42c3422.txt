Mildly decreased kidney filtration as a result of dehydration due to being fasting on the day.  This is usually not worrying and will improve when better hydrated. Review in3 months. 3. Borderline cholesterol and homocysteine levels. A very raised fasting insulin puts you at risk for developing diabetes and metabolic problems. Incorporate the suggested lifestyle changes and review in 6 months.
