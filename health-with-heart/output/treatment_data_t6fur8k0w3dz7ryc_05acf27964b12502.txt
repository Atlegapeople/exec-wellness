Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 32.1ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 1000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
2. Slightly reduced kidney function. Increase hydration & monitor annually.
3. Slightly raised total cholesterol & high triglycerides. Continue statin, avoid refined/processed food & sugars.
4. Your homocysteine is high at 17umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
