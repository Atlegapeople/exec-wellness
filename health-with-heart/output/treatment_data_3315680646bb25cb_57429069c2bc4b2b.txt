Pt has no cardiac symptoms at all, non-urgent cardiology consult advised.

ECG reported as following:
Normal sinus rhythm, S1T3, right axis deviation, mild electrical alternans, peaked T waves. Please correlate clinically.

Lung fx: 
Fev 1 and FVC each slightly low, but normal FEV1/FVC ratio of >70%, thus commented as normal/acceptable.

Overview Notes: The purpose of the Medical assessment is to screen for and identify possible physical and mental health concerns. The ECG and biochemical results showed abnormalities that need to be addressed but are not urgent. Please ensure that you follow up with your GP (and Cardiologist) for further evaluation. Continue taking care of your mental health by making time for mindful self-care.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1.  The ESR (an inflammatory/infection marker) is high. This may have several possible causes eg. infection or auto-immune disease.
2. Vitamin D levels are low which can improve by taking good supplements/eating vitamin D rich food.
3. The HS CRP (a marker of inflammation) was high. This  may be due to several factors eg. poor diet, alcohol and some chronic conditions.
4. Fasting insulin levels are high. This means you are insulin resistant (a precursor for Diabetes). It is still reversible with lifestyle modification! I'd like to encourage you try intermittent fasting and to consider seeing a Dietician.
5. The TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone) was high, which suggests you may have an underactive thyroid. 
The abnormalities found in the biochemistry are not urgent but need to be addressed. Please follow up with your GP in the next 8-12 weeks for repeat testing and further evaluation.

Comment Key: SpecialInvestigationRecommendation
Comment Value: The ECG had irregularities that suggests the conduction of the heart is toward the right, an irregular wave in one lead and "electrical alternans" (alternating height of the waves with each beat). This may be normal for you but should be reviewed by a cardiologist (and is not urgent).
Special Investigation Notes: ECG:
Sinus rhythm
RAD
Isolated T wave inversion in lead III, no other T wave abnormalities.
s1 q3 t3
Pt has no cardiac symptoms at all, non-urgent cardiology consult advised.

ECG reported as following:
Normal sinus rhythm, S1T3, right axis deviation, mild electrical alternans, peaked T waves. Please correlate clinically.

Lung fx: 
Fev 1 and FVC each slightly low, but normal FEV1/FVC ratio of >70%, thus commented as normal/acceptable.
Lung fx reported as moderate
