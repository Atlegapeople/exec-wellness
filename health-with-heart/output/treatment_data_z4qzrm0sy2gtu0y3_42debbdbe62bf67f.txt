2. Creatinine was low at 46 umol/L; this may be due to poor nutrition, low muscle bulk or other factors. The rest of the renal function is normal.
3. Homocysteine is high (marker of eg heart disease) and is affected by eg stress and lifestyle factors.
4. Triglycerides (fatty acid) are high; reduce trans fat, processed food and sugar intake.
5. High fasting insulin levels mean that you have insulin resistance. This is still reversible with lifestyle modification eg intermittent fasting.
6. Vitamin D is slightly low; this vitamin has multiple important functions.  Eat foods rich in Vit D like oily fish and use a good supplement.

Report Date: 2023-03-24
Doctor: Cindy Smit
Nurse: Ntombikayise Seane
Clinical Recommendations: Your fingers showed "Clubbing" (the nail shape looks like an upside-down spoon) which is a common finding (sign) in longstanding smokers.  This does not require investigation.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a Gynaecologists for a Pap smear and a Radiologist for a Mammogram.
Overview Notes: Lezelle, as you were made aware, there were a few concerning aspects identified during this assessment.  I would like to encourage you to adjust your lifestyle; this will take 3-6 months to show change.  Mental health is just as important as physical well-being. Try to make time for rest, relaxation and important relationships.  Remember, our doors are always open if you need assistance.

It has been a pleasure providing feedback to you!  I wish you a healthy and happy year ahead.

Yours in health,
Dr. Cindy Smit
