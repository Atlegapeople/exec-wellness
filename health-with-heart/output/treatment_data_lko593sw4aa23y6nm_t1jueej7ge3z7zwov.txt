Comment Value: Jaco it was a pleasure meeting you and being part of your wellbeing journey. Apart from the abnormal lipogram and slightly raised blood pressure - you are in very good health. You understand the importance of a healthy diet and regular exercise - rest is also important.
We have discussed what supplements to use. Make sure you have a review done at your GP or one of our Wellness Centre doctors with a repeat in blood pressure and cholesterol levels in 6 months time. Hope the festive time is one of rest and recuperation.
See you in our Wellbeing Centre soon.
