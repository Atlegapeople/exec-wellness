Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Low Vitamin D levels. This can increased by eating Vit D rich food (eg oily fish and mushrooms) and by taking a good supplement.
2. HS CRP was high. It can indicate underlying inflammation/infection but may be due to other factors. Insulin resistance and high cholesterol can contribute.
3. High homocysteine is linked with heart disease, auto-immune and other conditions. It can be affected by several factors eg stress, toxins and medication.
4. High cholesterol and LDL can be reduced by limiting animal product consumption and taking Omega3 and Niacin supplements. This test can be repeated in 6 months. 
5. High fasting insulin levels means you are insulin resistant (a precursor for Diabetes). This is still reversible! 
6. Cortisol is low and may be due to recent corticosteroid use or other factors. Repeat test in 8 weeks recommended.
