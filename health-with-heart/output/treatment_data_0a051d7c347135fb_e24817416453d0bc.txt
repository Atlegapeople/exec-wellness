Comment Value: 1. Slightly large red blood cells noted - this maybe due to a B12 or folate deficiency which I suggest you test for. I would also recommend that you continue with your prenatal supplements whilst breastfeeding.
2. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 20.4ng/ml. Please supplement with D-lux vitamin D spray, 3 sprays daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
