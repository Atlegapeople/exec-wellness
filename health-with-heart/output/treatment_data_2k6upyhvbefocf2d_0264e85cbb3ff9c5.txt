Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is low at 17.3ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
2. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 11umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins eg Stellar Active Folate/Metagenics phytomulti. Recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l. 
3. High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. The most important factors to address to try to reverse this are your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose 10% of your body weight.
4. Your cortisol is on the high side due to high stress levels. Supplementing with ashwagandha and magnesium may help.

Overview Notes: Nomcebo you had an incredibly traumatic experience at the end of last year which has caused extremely high stress levels. This has impacted your sleep and overall well being. Now that your son is doing well I hope that you can take some time to heal and practice some mindful self care. Please recheck your fasting insulin levels in 3 months and then we can follow up.
