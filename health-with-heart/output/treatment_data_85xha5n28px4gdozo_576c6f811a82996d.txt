Comment Value: Your cholesterol is well controlled on your blood work. The medication and lifestyle habits you have formed will both help maintain this. Your kidney function was slightly reduced. This is most likely due to the fact that the bloods were taken when fasting. We can repeat them in 2/12 to ensure normal levels (while hydrated). The Vitamin D supplementation you’ve been taking shows adequate levels.
