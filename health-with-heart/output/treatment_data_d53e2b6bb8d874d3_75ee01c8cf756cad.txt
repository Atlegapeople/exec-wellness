Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 22.3ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
2. hsCRp is a marker of inflammation - yours falls in the average risk category. To reduce it try to avoid sugar, highly processed foods, toxins (smoking) and stress etc. High quality Omega 3 and Curcumin (Tumeric) are both excellent anti-inflammatory supplements.
3. Your fasting insulin level is within normal but higher than optimal. Try to reduce sugar and refined carbohydrates, start exercising and reduce stress.
