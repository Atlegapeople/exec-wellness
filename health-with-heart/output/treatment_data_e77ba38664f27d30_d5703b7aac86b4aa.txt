Overview Notes: Thank you for booking your medical with us. In preparation for this appointment you have already lost 4kg and are exercising daily and feeding your body more intentionally. It's clear you are emerging from a stressful work period and you finally have the capacity to make space for looking after your body well again. Losing the weight you have gained and restoring your muscle mass and fitness will resolve the metabolic indicators on your blood panel. I would like to repeat these after a few months next year and we can talk through those with your DNA analysis when we chat again. For now, please continue with exercise, less sugar, heavy weight lifting and take some vitamin D when you remember. Continue to screen your moles annually as you have a fair skin. Have a wonderful festive season and maintain your new lifestyle knowing that the fruits will pay off soon with more energy, vitality and presence.

Overview Notes: Thank you for booking your medical with us. In preparation for this appointment you have already lost 4kg and are exercising daily and feeding your body more intentionally. It's clear you are emerging from a stressful work period and you finally have the capacity to make space for looking after your body well again. Losing the weight you have gained and restoring your muscle mass and fitness will resolve the metabolic indicators on your blood panel. I would like to repeat these after a few months next year and we can talk through those with your DNA analysis when we chat again. For now, please continue with exercise, less sugar, heavy weight lifting and take some vitamin D when you remember. Continue to screen your moles annually as you have a fair skin. Have a wonderful festive season and maintain your new lifestyle knowing that the fruits will pay off soon with more energy, vitality and presence.
Comment Key: MentalHealthStressRecommendation
Comment Value: In spite of your high pressure and stress and the new undertaking you have embarked on, you compartmentalise very well and are enjoying your life and work. I would encourage you to make more space for 'Luke time' that is just for you to rest your nervous system.
