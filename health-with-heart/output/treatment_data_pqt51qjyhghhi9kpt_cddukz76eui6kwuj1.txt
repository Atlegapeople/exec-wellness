Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Men's Health Recommendations: Please report any new worrying or persistent urinary symptoms to your doctor.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Men's Health Recommendations: Monitor and visit your doctor if you experience any urinary symptoms.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.

Overview Notes: Continue your statin seeing as it has no side effects and watch the saturated fat in your diet to keep your bad cholesterol (the one that blocks up your ateries) under check. So limit the intake of animal fats, cheese and butter. Rather choose healthier fats from avo, olives and fatty fish. Omega 3 supplements can also help your cholesterol levels.
