Clinical Recommendations: There were no current concerns on your examination. Regular screening of any skin lesions is recommended - ‘Mole Mapping’ can be done with a Dermatologist. If any changes in size/ shape/ colour of a skin mark - to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Clinical Recommendations: There were no current concerns on your examination. Regular screening of any skin lesions is recommended - ‘Mole Mapping’ can be done with a Dermatologist. If any changes in size/ shape/ colour of a skin mark - to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Report Date: 2024-08-23
Doctor: Melinda Whitfield
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: There were no current concerns on your examination. Regular screening of any skin lesions is recommended - ‘Mole Mapping’ can be done with a Dermatologist. If any changes in size/ shape/ colour of a skin mark - to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: Try meds I've given you and let me know if all is good. Please see Urologist regularly for check ups.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Philip, it was lovely to see you again. You have a few aspects of your health to work on to get back to the fit surfer travelling in Brazil! Weight, weights, weights. No more sodas. Watch your toxic load. Consider creatine and getting a trainer. Specialists - shoulder (Breckon), toe (xray & general ortho), palm (dermatologist), prostate (urologist). Let's repeat your testosterone and insulin early next year and let's get you strong, full of energy and chasing your little boy around the garden! Look after yourself.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.
