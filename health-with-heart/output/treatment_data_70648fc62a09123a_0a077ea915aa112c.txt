Comment Value: 1.Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 35 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
2. Your total cholesterol/LDL cholesterol is mildly above the normal reference range. However you report that it has been like this for years and is not increasing. You already have a healthy diet and exercise frequently and your inflammation levels are nice and low so just continue to monitor it annually. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg and Glucochol22.
