Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D is within normal levels but can be more optimal.  Supplement for 3 months and review with a doctor.
2. Very raised total, LDL and triglycerides cholesterol.  Incorporate exercise that increases your heart rate and be mindful of dietary triggers. Visit a dietician for guidance if unsure. Retest in 3 - 6 months.
3. Raised ongoing inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Decrease sugar containing foods and start exercise. Manage stress and better sleep where you can.
4. A raised fasting insulin indicates the start of abnormal sugar metabolism. Avoiding high sugar foods and doing exercise that builds healthy muscle will help improve this.
