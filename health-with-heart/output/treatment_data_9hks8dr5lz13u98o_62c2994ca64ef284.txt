Comment Value: 1. Slightly raised liver enzymes. You were previously diagnosed with a fatty liver on ultrasound. Continue with your diet and weight loss and this should resolve. Glutathione &/ milk thistle can also support the liver.
2. High hsCRP level suggestive of inflammation. Again continue with your lifestyle changes and this should improve. Omega 3 and curcumin supplements may also help.
3. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 10 umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
