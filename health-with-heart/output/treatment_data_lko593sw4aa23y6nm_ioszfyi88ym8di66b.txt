Overview Notes: Keep an eye on your cholesterol levels. I would not recommend medication at this stage but focus on your lifestyle. Eat a low-salt mediterranean style diet. Limit the amount of animal fats and use good fats in moderation, maintain a healthy weight, quit smoking, continue exercising regularly, drink alcohol in moderation, if at all and manage stress.
