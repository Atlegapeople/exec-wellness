Comment Key: MedicalHistoryNote
Comment Value: Very few concerns have been raised in this medical. At the time of consultation you had a upper respiratory tract infection which made the lung function test difficult but I was still happy with the results. You are extremely fit with a slow heart rate of 50 and an excellent body composition. The only abnormal blood result was your total cholesterol and the LDL (bad cholesterol), however the results are not too high and you have a very low risk for heart attack after taking other risk factors into account. With this in mind I can only advise you follow a healthy diet full of veg and fruit and low GI wholegrains and healthy fats instead of fat from meat and butter. Its also important to manage stress levels!
Your score on your mental health screen flagged a bit of anxiety which is due to current work pressure and stress. This should not be a long term situation, if it is please take strides to manage anxiety and stress such as mindfulness, recreation and meditation.
You are in good health and I wish you the best of luck for your triathlon in Paris!
