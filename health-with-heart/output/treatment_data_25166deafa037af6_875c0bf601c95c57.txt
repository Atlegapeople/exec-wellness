Comment Value: 1. Mildly reduced kidney function. Ensure adequate hydration, avoid pain killers and monitor BP. Repeat kidney function in 3 months.
2. Very mildly increased total & LDL cholesterol. Avoid too much saturated fat and processed foods. Try to start exercising.
3. High hsCRP - indicating high inflammation levels. Can be associated with high waist circumference & high insulin levels. Improve diet & exercise and monitor. Omega 3 and curcumin supplementation is advised.
4. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 10umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. e.g. Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare. Recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l. 
5. Raised fasting insulin levels. This could indicate insulin resistance/ pre-diabetes. Try to follow a low carb diet, start exercising and lose weight. Recheck in 3 months.
