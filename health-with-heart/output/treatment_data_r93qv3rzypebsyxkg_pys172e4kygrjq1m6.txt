Comment Value: Hendrik overall you seem to be in good health. You expressed some concerns regarding your risk for prostate cancer due to family history. A baseline assessment by a urologist is a good idea however your PSA is normal and you are currently asymptomatic. Please be mindful of your diet and lifestyle - reduce red meat intake and caffeine intake and ensure enough rest and fun! It was a pleasure to do your medical and I look forward to seeing you again.
