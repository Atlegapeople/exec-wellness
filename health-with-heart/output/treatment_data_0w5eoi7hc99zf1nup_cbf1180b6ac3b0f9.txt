Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your HsCRP (chronic inflammatory marker) is at 5.2 mg/l. 
This puts you at high risk for cardiovascular disease, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have pushed the level up. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks. Our target is <1mg/l.
2. The LDL ("bad" cholesterol) and non-HDL are high. This can be lowered by frequent exercise and a healthy diet - the Mediterranean diet is a good example
3. Your homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
4. Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at  17 ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 1000iu daily and recheck the level in 3 months.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your HsCRP (chronic inflammatory marker) is at 5.2 mg/l. 
This puts you at high risk for cardiovascular disease, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have pushed the level up. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks. Our target is <1mg/l.
2. The LDL ("bad" cholesterol) and non-HDL are high. This can be lowered by frequent exercise and a healthy diet - the Mediterranean diet is a good example
3. Your homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
