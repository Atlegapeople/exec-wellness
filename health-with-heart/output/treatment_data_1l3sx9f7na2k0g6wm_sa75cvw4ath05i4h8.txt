Overview Notes: An increased waist circumference is associated with an increased risk of chronic disease such as heart disease and diabetes. Your waist circumference is 95cm, just above the maximum recommended measurement of 94cm. Try to lose a bit of weight around your abdomen to negate this risk by increasing your activity levels and watching the sugars and carbohydrates.
