Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Mild irregularities on your full blood count which is not very worrying. Monitor with your next opportunity. 2. A mild decrease in kidney function probably due to being dehydrated on the day (as you come fasting for other tests), monitor in 3 months. 3. Raised inflammatory marker (ultra-sensitive CRP) and homocysteine levels. Make sure you eat enough veggies rich in B-vitamins to help improve this.
