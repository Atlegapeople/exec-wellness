Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Mildly raised inflammatory marker - could be due to training or mild underlying viral infection.
2. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 34ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
3. Moderately low neutrophil count - possibly due to underlying viral infection at time of bloods which correlates clinically with how you felt and your increased heart rate.
4. Low DHEA and lower cortisol levels suggest that you have been stressed for a prolonged period of time (history of "chronic fatigue") - please prioritise rest and stress management.
