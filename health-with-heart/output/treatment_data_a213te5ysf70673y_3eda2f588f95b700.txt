Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly low MCH and MCHC - which may indicate an early iron deficiency. Ensure enough iron in diet and do iron studies on next bloods.
2. Your Vit D level is low at 15.7ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. 
3. High uric acid levels - avoid alcohol, too much red meat and fructose. Ensure very good hydration to flush uric acid out.
4. High levels of inflammation - can be due to insulin resistance, stress and sugar in diet.
5. Very high fasting insulin levels. Left untreated this can lead to type two diabetes. The most important factors to address are your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars & refined carbs, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose 10% of your body weight.
