Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vit D levels are suboptimal. Replace with Vit D3 5000iu daily and repeat levels in 3/12. Aim for a level of 60-80
- hs-CRP is raised. Low levels of inflammation is a bad prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease in the future. Improve your diet as discussed and repeat levels in 3/12
- DHEA is slightly low. You have a newborn in the house, stress levels are not at an all time low. However "resting and digesting" enough is important. We spoke about breathing exercises, mindfulness, taking cold showers and walking barefoot on grass for 10mins each day.
