MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Bongi Hazel Dlamini
Report Date: 2025-08-04
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You examine well clinically. Your blood pressure was slightly elevated, and we can monitor this over the next few months. The lifestyle changes we discussed, such as regular exercise and weight management, will help improve your readings.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. In women’s health, this includes Pap smears & Mammograms. I’m glad your recent mammogram was clear. Given your family history, regular screening is important. Your next Pap smear is due and can be done here or with your gynaecologist.
Overview Notes: Overall, you’re becoming more mindful of your daily rhythms and how they influence your health. Your medical picked up a few early indicators that, with the right lifestyle changes, can be improved to help prevent chronic illness and future complications.

Change takes time, but small, consistent steps can create a big impact on your health and well-being. You’re already moving in the right direction, and building on these habits will only strengthen your results.

We’ll repeat your ECG later this year and plan for another full review at your annual medical next year.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Overall, there were no major concerns on your blood work. Your cholesterol was slightly elevated, and your hsCRP (a marker of low-grade inflammation) was also raised. Improving your lifestyle—through regular exercise and reducing inflammatory foods like sugar—can help lower these levels. Your low vitamin D can be optimised with a high-dose supplement for 3 months. We can repeat the test next year during your follow-up medical.

Clinical Recommendations: You examine well clinically. Your blood pressure was slightly elevated, and we can monitor this over the next few months. The lifestyle changes we discussed, such as regular exercise and weight management, will help improve your readings.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. In women’s health, this includes Pap smears & Mammograms. I’m glad your recent mammogram was clear. Given your family history, regular screening is important. Your next Pap smear is due and can be done here or with your gynaecologist.
Overview Notes: Overall, you’re becoming more mindful of your daily rhythms and how they influence your health. Your medical picked up a few early indicators that, with the right lifestyle changes, can be improved to help prevent chronic illness and future complications.

Change takes time, but small, consistent steps can create a big impact on your health and well-being. You’re already moving in the right direction, and building on these habits will only strengthen your results.

We’ll repeat your ECG later this year and plan for another full review at your annual medical next year.
