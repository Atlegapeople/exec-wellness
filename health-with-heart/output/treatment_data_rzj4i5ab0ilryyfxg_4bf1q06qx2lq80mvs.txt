Overview Notes: Urinary symptoms: waking up at night with an urge to urinate and increased urge to urinate during the day without significant volumes of urine. Could be related to an issue with your prostate. The blood prostate marker (PSA) was normal and urine normal. I suggest you consult with a urologist for further evaluation as you say this has been going on for sometime.
