Comment Value: You live a healthy lifestyle in general and this will have many protective and beneficial effects on your health.
The one red flag picked up is your cholesterol levels which are pushing your cardiac age up to 57 y and your risk for a cardiovascular event up to 11.2%. This is classified as a moderate risk. If you could reduce your cholesterol to under 5 the risk would decrease to 7.9% which is low risk and your cardiac age would be 51 years. I suggest chatting to your GP or cardiologist about restarting meds or other options. Your diet is healthy already but you need to be very aware of avoiding animal fats and try to increase your fish, veggie and fibre intake which may help. Keep up the daily exercise which is protecting you by keeping your good cholesterol high enough.
From a screening point of view you are due for a colonoscope and a dermatology check up. Your prostate screening was reassuring I advise yearly PSA and prostate checks.
Your mental health is excellent and you look after your self well. I wish you good health for 2019 and look forward to seeing you next year.
