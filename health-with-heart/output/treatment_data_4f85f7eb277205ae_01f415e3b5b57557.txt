Women's Health Recommendations: Your menstrual cycle has recently been irregular. This is likely due to the stressful season it has been. You can follow-up with your GP/ Gynae if these irregularities persist. Regular Pap Smear screening is important to help detect any abnormalities early.
Overview Notes: There were a few areas that we identified that can be optimised in order to improve your current general health as well as prevent future chronic illness. Reducing sugar intake & starting an exercise routine can have many benefits. 

Building healthy practices & lifestyle changes can have a big impact. It takes time to develop these habits - but keep going!

You’ve had a stressful year but been doing so well. I hope you enjoy your time away in December!
