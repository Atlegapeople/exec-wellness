Comment Value: Sinus bradycardia can be a normal finding in athletes,  exercise strengthens the heart muscle. It allows it to pump a greater amount of blood with each heartbeat. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete.
