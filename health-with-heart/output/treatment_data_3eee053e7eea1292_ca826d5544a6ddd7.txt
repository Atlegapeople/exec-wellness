Report Date: 2024-03-20
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Clinically you examine well. Your blood pressure was slightly raised. We will need to repeat this in a few weeks again. Regular self-breast examinations are recommended. If you detect any irregularities, you can review with your known family GP or Gynae.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you’ve been seen and reviewed by a Gynaecologist. You are due another Pap Smear this year. This can be done with your known Gynae. We also discussed the different contraceptive options. I have sent you information regarding IUD devices (Mirena/ Copper IUD).
Overview Notes: We discussed some of the lifestyle areas for optimisation to help improve not only your current health but your long-term well being. Working on building healthy rhythms of exercise and nutrition into your daily life will have a positive impact on your body. It will help prevent future chronic illness. 

Making these changes can be hard, but are so worthwhile in the long run. We are here to support you in whatever way we can.

Comment Value: There were a few markers that were slightly raised. Your liver function is showing warning signs of being impacted. Reducing your alcohol intake may restore these levels. Your high urate levels may also improve with nutritional changes and reduced alcohol. We can repeat your liver function test in x4 months. There was also a marker for inflammation in the body that was raised (hsCRP). We discussed how exercise, improved diet and weight loss can reduce this. However it may have also been due to a sub clinical infection at the time. We can also repeat this marker on your next blood work.
