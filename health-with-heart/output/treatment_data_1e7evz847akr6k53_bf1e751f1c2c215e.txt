Comment Value: 1. Evidence of increased alcohol use on your full blood count and liver function tests. Reduce to 1-2 drinks on a day.  
2. Your Vitamin D is normal at 30 but can be more optimal close to 50.  You can supplement this for 3 months and review with a doctor.
3. Raised background inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Reduce this by decreasing sugar and alcohol and increasing veggies rich in anti-oxidants.
4. A raised insulin and very borderline fasting glucose.  Decrease sugar and make sure you are building some muscle with your exercise. Aim to reduce your waistline.  Review with your doctor with an HBA1c test in 3 months - if this gets worse we may need to start medication for Diabetes Mellitus!
5. Follow up with a urologist for a raised PSA.
