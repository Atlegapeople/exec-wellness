Overview Notes: I would suggest that you see a physician. You have a history of numerous episodes of possible clotting issues as well as blood in your urine, with the last being last year in August with your episode of chest pain. I feel like a thorough work up would be prudent.

Women's Health Recommendations: -Cancer screening is important, especially when you are taking hormone replacement. Please see your gynaecologist for a Pap smear & ultrasound and a radiologist for a mammogram.
Overview Notes: I would suggest that you see a physician. You have a history of numerous episodes of possible clotting issues as well as blood in your urine, with the last being last year in August with your episode of chest pain. I feel like a thorough work up would be prudent.
