Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some chamomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some chamomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some chamomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some chamomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some chamomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some chamomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Men's Health Recommendations: Please report any new or persistent urinary symptoms to your doctor.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some chamomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone.
