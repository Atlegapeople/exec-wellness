Comment Key: VitalsNote
Comment Value: The patient just started hypertensive treatment, RX not taken this morning. Advised to have breakfast, take treatment an return in the afternoon for BP check and also during the weekend at Clicks/Dischem.
Note from Dr: Reports she was advised by her GP to start Rx but that she first wanted to see if SSRI will help with stress. Advised SSRI alone is unlikely to help a BP that high and must please follow up for BP rx.  She was still reluctant but reported she will go to her own dr.
