Comment Value: Jefferson you currently seem to be in good health with no 'red flags'. As mentioned your liver enzymes are marginally raised as is your cholesterol. Pay attention to your diet, lifestyle and stress management and then recheck the levels in a few months. If the raised liver enzymes persist you can do a liver ultrasound. It was great to meet you and do your medical today.
