MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Ashwin Lakhan
Report Date: 2023-10-09
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You examined clinically well with a BMI and body fat % within normal ranges. You can find your hearing assessment report attached. All readings were within normal ranges with no concern.
Men's Health Recommendations: Your blood results showed a normal PSA level. However these levels can be reduced with certain medications (Finasteride). Currently there is no concern as you report no symptoms related to your prostate. As you get older, both clinical prostate screening & PSA levels can be repeated.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you report a good baseline and have been building into your lifestyle positive habits to improve your current health. This will also benefit your long term health and reduce your risk of chronic illness.  

There were a few areas we identified for improvement. We can repeat your blood levels in the next few weeks to ensure normal levels on non-fasting bloods. 

I hope the rest of the year goes well. We are here to help in whatever way we can to optimise your wellness. 

Warm regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Comment Value: These bloods were taking after a fasting period. This mild state of dehydration at the time is mostly likely the underlying cause for your reduced kidney filtration rate. We can repeat these levels with non-fasting bloods to see if the level improves. There were also a few markers that were slightly out of range, however nothing that I am currently concerned about. We can add these to your repeated blood work-up to get comparative results.

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: Your blood results showed a normal PSA level. However these levels can be reduced with certain medications (Finasteride). Currently there is no concern as you report no symptoms related to your prostate. As you get older, both clinical prostate screening & PSA levels can be repeated.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you report a good baseline and have been building into your lifestyle positive habits to improve your current health. This will also benefit your long term health and reduce your risk of chronic illness.  

There were a few areas we identified for improvement. We can repeat your blood levels in the next few weeks to ensure normal levels on non-fasting bloods. 

I hope the rest of the year goes well. We are here to help in whatever way we can to optimise your wellness. 

Warm regards,

Comment Value: As mentioned previously, you’ve been building great methods of reducing your chronic stress levels. Taking your annual leave and time to rest is also important. I am glad to hear that it has been a good start to the year and that you had time off recently.
