MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: David Johnson
Report Date: 2022-08-31
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: There were no current concerns on your examination. Regular screening of any skin lesions is recommended - ‘Mole Mapping’ can be done with a Dermatologist. If any changes in size/ shape/ colour of a skin mark - to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: As you get older (>40 years) - routine screening becomes important to help early detection & management of any irregularities. In males, this means regular prostate examinations and PSA blood levels. This is something to bear in mind in the next few years.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline. There were a few areas that we identified that can be optimised in order to improve your current general health as well as prevent future chronic illness. Reducing your sugar intake and stress management can make a big difference. 

Building healthy habits into our lives takes time but has many positive benefits on your long term health -  keep going!

Comment Value: 1. High Cholesterol Levels - This can be reduced with lifestyle changes (diet/ exercise). Supplements can also possibly help control your levels (Omega 3/ RyChol). To repeat bloods in 4/12 to determine need for further management. 
2. Raised hsCRP - This is a marker for low grade inflammation in the body which puts you at higher risk for cardiovascular events. Your raised levels are likely due to a viral flu at the time your bloods were taken. 
3. Low Cortisol Levels - This can be caused by many different factors. It can be due to fatigue and chronic stress/ burnout. It is something we can monitor, along with any symptoms, and investigate further if needed.
