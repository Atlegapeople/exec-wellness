Comment Value: 1.Your vitamin D levels are normal but could be better.  You can supplement with Vit D3 3 times a week. 2. A raised uric acid will predispose you to gout. Keep avoiding excessive alcohol and red meat. 3. Mild raised inflammation on US-CRP, most likely due to reduced sleep currently as the rest of your lifestyle is ok.  This will improve when your sleep has room to improve again.
