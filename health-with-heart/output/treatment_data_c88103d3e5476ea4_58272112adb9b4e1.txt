Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is low at 18ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml.
2. Slightly raised GGT liver enzyme - could be due to a "fatty liver" associated with increased waist circumference and high insulin levels.
3. Low HDL cholesterol - can increase through exercise and omega 3. High LDL and triglycerides - can reduce through dietary changes - reduce saturated fat, all processed foods and refined carbs/sugar.
4. Borderline fasting glucose levels and high fasting insulin suggesting insulin resistance/ pre diabetes. Continue exercising, follow a low carb diet and try to lose weight. Consider seeing Pippa the dietician. Repeat bloods in 3 months and follow up.
