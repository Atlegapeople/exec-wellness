Comment Value: 1. Mild features of anemia on full blood count. Increase iron rich veggies (where possible in the setting of warfarin), eat red meat 1-2x a week.  Review in 3 months.
2. Vitamin D normal at 21, can be more optimal at 50.  Supplement for 3 months and review.
3. Low HDL (good cholesterol which is protective). Eat more nuts and olive oil (healthy fats).
4. Raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Work to improve sleep and stress and eat super foods rich in anti-oxidants.
5. Raised homocysteine. Vegetables rich in B-vitamins will help reduce this.
