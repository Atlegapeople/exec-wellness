Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: There were a few abnormalities noted on your blood work. Your low Vit D levels can be supplemented and re-checked in x3 months. There were signs of developing metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (raised fasting insulin levels/ high total cholesterol). Together with increased levels on inflammation in the body (hsCRP) and higher homocysteine levels, this can be an indicator for increased risk for future cardiovascular complications. I recommend going to consult an Endocrinologist Specialist. We can also follow-up repeat blood work in the next few months. Making some of the lifestyle changes we discussed with hopefully positively impact these warning signs.
