Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D is low at 19 and should be optimal at 50.  Take a supplement for 3 months and review with your doctor.
2. One liver enzyme very mildly raised. Reduce daily alcohol and review this test in 3 months.
3. Mild inflammation on ultra sensitive CRP. Be mindful to manage stress and good sleep and reduce sugar.  Manage chronic sources of inflammation (from reflux and endometriosis) as much as possible.
4. Impaired adrenal stress response.  Make time to switch off "fight and flight" to rest and digest.  A healthy lifestyle also helps to improve this.
