Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your full blood count shows features of dehydration on the day (due to being fasting for the blood tests), which is not usually worrying. I suggest following up with a full blood count when not fasting to monitor that this is able to return to normal.
2. Your vitamin D level is low at 19, close to 50 is optimal. Supplement for 3 months and review with a doctor.
3. Your total and LDL cholesterol is elevated. Your lifestyle is already quite good, perhaps follow up with a dietician to review your daily eating habits and trial Rhychol (an OTC supplement).  If still high in 6 months discuss the need for medication with a doctor.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your full blood count shows features of dehydration on the day (due to being fasting for the blood tests), which is not usually worrying. I suggest following up with a full blood count when not fasting to monitor that this is able to return to normal.
2. Your vitamin D level is low at 19, close to 50 is optimal. Supplement for 3 months and review with a doctor.
3. Your total and LDL cholesterol is elevated. Your lifestyle is already quite good, perhaps follow up with a dietician to review your daily eating habits and trial Rhychol (an OTC supplement).  If still high in 6 months discuss the need for medication with a doctor.
