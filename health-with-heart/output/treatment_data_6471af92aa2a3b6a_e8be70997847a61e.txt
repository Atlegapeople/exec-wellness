Report Date: 2023-09-13
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You had no current clinical concerns. Your BMI was reported slightly high on your report - however this is likely due to an increased muscle mass from strength training and is not concerning. For further information on body mass - see report from Biokineticist.

Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline and have been building some good lifestyle habits over the past few years. Improving and maintaining these will benefit not only your current well-being but also your long term health.

Comment Value: Your total cholesterol was high. We can trial lifestyle changes (diet) for the next x3 months and repeat your blood work. If persistently raised we may need to start an oral medication. Your Vit D levels were low. This we can supplement for the next x3 months to boost your baseline levels. The slightly lowered kidney function noted - is most likely due to dehydration at the time your bloods were taken. We can also repeat these levels on your next bloods.
