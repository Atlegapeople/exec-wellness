Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A raised BMI and a waist circumference over 80cm increases your risk for chronic disease such as heart disease and diabetes (as does your family history and smoking). Try to lose some weight by improving your diet and managing your stress. You are already very active so that is not where the issue lies. Focus on a lower carb, high veg, higher healthy fat diet.

Overview Notes: A raised BMI and a waist circumference over 80cm increases your risk for chronic disease such as heart disease and diabetes (as does your family history and smoking). Try to lose some weight by improving your diet and managing your stress. You are already very active so that is not where the issue lies. Focus on a lower carb, high veg, higher healthy fat diet.

Overview Notes: A raised BMI and a waist circumference over 80cm increases your risk for chronic disease such as heart disease and diabetes (as does your family history and smoking). Try to lose some weight by improving your diet and managing your stress. You are already very active so that is not where the issue lies. Focus on a lower carb, high veg, higher healthy fat diet.
