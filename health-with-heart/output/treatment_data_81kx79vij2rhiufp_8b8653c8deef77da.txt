MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Matthew Eb
Report Date: 2022-10-20
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You have a few moles & skin pigmentation noted on examination. These may become more prominent as you spend more time outside (esp with cycling). Mole mapping can be done through a dermatologist. Any change in the shape, colour or size of a skin lesion should be reviewed by a doctor.
Men's Health Recommendations: As you get older (>40 years) - routine screening becomes important to help early detection & management of any irregularities. In males, this means regular prostate examinations and PSA blood levels. This is something to bear in mind in the next few years.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline with healthy habits. There were a few areas that we identified to be optimised. These lifestyle adjustments we discussed can have a positive impact on general wellbeing as well as your long term health. 

We can repeat your renal function & cholesterol levels in the next few weeks to ensure proper functioning and control. 

Warm regards,

Comment Value: Your blood work showed a raised cholesterol. This can be managed with diet, lifestyle adjustments & omega 3 supplements - however we may need to start a low dose Statin if not controlled. Your renal function was low. You may have been dehydrated at the time of your bloods - but we will need to repeat this in the next few weeks to ensure there are no underlying problems (esp with single kidney). Your testosterone levels are within the normal range for your age category.

Clinical Recommendations: You have a few moles & skin pigmentation noted on examination. These may become more prominent as you spend more time outside (esp with cycling). Mole mapping can be done through a dermatologist. Any change in the shape, colour or size of a skin lesion should be reviewed by a doctor.
Men's Health Recommendations: As you get older (>40 years) - routine screening becomes important to help early detection & management of any irregularities. In males, this means regular prostate examinations and PSA blood levels. This is something to bear in mind in the next few years.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline with healthy habits. There were a few areas that we identified to be optimised. These lifestyle adjustments we discussed can have a positive impact on general wellbeing as well as your long term health. 

We can repeat your renal function & cholesterol levels in the next few weeks to ensure proper functioning and control. 

Warm regards,
Dr Jessica Koen
