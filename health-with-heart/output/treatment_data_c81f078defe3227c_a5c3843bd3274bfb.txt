Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. A reduced filtration rate is often due to being dehydrated on the day (due to being fasting for the other tests). Recommend to monitor when well hydrated in 3 months. 2. High triglycerides on fasting cholesterol test and mild inflammation - this will improve if you decrease daily sugar and refined carbs. 3. Your TSH is out of range and was normal with your previous visit to us. Do the full monitoring and follow up with a doctor, your Eltroxin may be lacking.
