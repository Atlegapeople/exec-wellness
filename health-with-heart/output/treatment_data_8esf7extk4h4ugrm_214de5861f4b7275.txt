Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D:  Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at  20ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily and recheck the level in 3 months. We recommend the Metagenics D3.  Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
-Your homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
-Your “bad” cholesterol is high. This can be lowered by limiting saturated and trans fats from your diet, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods and replacing all refined carbs with those high in fibre.
