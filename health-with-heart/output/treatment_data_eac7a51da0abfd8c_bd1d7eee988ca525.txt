Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is very low at 8 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3/12. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is very high. Please take Metagenics MethylCare (Wellness Warehouse/Faithful to Nature) & recheck the level in 3/12. Aim for <7 umol/l. 
3. Your total&LDL cholesterol is raised. Before we consider medication make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar and refined carbs.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for at least 30 min. We usually give these interventions a good 3-6months before we review. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg and Glucochol22. Repeat levels in 3/12
4. Your hsCRP was above optimal. This puts you in the high risk category for cardiovascular disease. Please keep an eye on BP & cholesterol.
