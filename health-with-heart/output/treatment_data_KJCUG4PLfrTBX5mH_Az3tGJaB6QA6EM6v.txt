Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your homocysteine levels were raised. This can be reduced with increasing your folate/ Vit B6/ Vit B12 levels. Eating a wider variety of vegetables (especially leafy greens) can help improve your intake. We can also give you a Vit B12 injection at the practice to help this. Your hsCRP was also raised. This may be due to a sub clinical infection at the time your bloods were taken. We can repeat this level in a few months to ensure it has corrected. Otherwise the rest of your blood work showed no concern.
