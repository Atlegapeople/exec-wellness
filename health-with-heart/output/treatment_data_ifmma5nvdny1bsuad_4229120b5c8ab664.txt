Comment Value: 1. Slightly low red cell count & mildly reduced neutrophils. Please repeat in 2 to 3 weeks.
2. Suboptimal vitamin D level 23.9ng/ml. Supplement with vit D3 2000iu daily and recheck levels in 4 to 6 months.
3. Your kidney function is mildly reduced but would not be considered kidney disease unless persistent. Please repeat and ensure good hydration.
4. Slightly increased AST liver enzyme. Reduce alcohol consumption and try to reduce abdominal fat. Milk thistle can also support liver function.
5. High total/LDL cholesterol - ensure a healthy diet (decrease animal fat, increase veg, minimise refined carbs/sugar/processed food), exercise 5 times a week. Omega 3, niacin and rychol are supplements that may assist.
6. Above optimal homocysteine levels - supplement with methylated B vitamins e.g metagenics methylcare.
7. Low DHEA level - suggests chronic ongoing stress. Try to reduce stress - rest, relaxation, mindfulness/ breathing techniques.
