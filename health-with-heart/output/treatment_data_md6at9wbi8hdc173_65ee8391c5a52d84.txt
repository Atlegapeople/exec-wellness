Comment Value: 1. The renal function was slightly impaired. It may be due to dehydration (you were fasting when the blood was collected for testing).
2. The ALT and AST (liver enzymes) were elevated. This may be due to several factors eg. medication, toxins or infection. 
3. HS CRP (a marker of inflammation) was slightly raised. There are multiple possible causes eg. stress, poor diet, auto-immune disease.
The abnormalities found in the biochemistry are not urgent but need to be addressed. Please follow up with your GP in the next 8-12 weeks for repeat testing and further evaluation.
