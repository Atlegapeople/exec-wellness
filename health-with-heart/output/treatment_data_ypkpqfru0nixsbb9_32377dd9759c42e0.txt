Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Possible viral infection on full blood count.  Monitor and repeat in one month if still feeling very fatigued.
2. Vitamin D normal at 29 but can be more optimal at 50.  Supplement with a 1000iu daily for about 3 months and review.
3. Lower than expected kidney filtration which may not be necessarily abnormal.  Drink enough water and review in 3 months with your doctor.
4. Mildly raised total cholesterol and LDL.  You already live a good lifestyle.  Omega3 and Niacin supplements may help improve this.  If it is genetic then it may not change and worsen with age.  Monitor yearly to review the need for medication.
5. Normal homocysteine but can be more optimal.  Consider homocysteine modulators/ methylated B vitamins to improve this.
6. Follow up high DHEA with an endocrinologist specialist.
