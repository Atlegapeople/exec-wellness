Comment Value: 1. One of your liver enzymes is slightly raised. Watch your alcohol intake and consider taking milk thistle or glutathione to support your liver.
2. usCRP is a non specific inflammatory marker. Your level puts you in the average risk category for heart disease. 
3. Your TSH is high suggesting inadequate dosage of your euthyrox, however you recently had it tested before renewing your script and it was fine and you report feeling fine. I suggest repeating it to confirm.
4. Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at 27ng/ml. I would suggest supplementing with 4000iu of vitamin D daily and retest in 4 to 6 months aiming for a level of 5o to 80ng/ml.
5. DHEA level is low - this can happen as we get older but can also be an indication of prolonged stress. Please prioritize rest, relaxation and mindful self-care.

Overview Notes: Colette overall you seem to be in great health - you are very active and have a good diet. Continue to monitor your thyroid levels. Please also make sure that you prioritize rest, relaxation and self-care as prolonged exposure to stress affects cognition and mood as well as increasing your risk of chronic diseases. However you seem to be coping well currently. It was a pleasure to do your medical and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. One of your liver enzymes is slightly raised. Watch your alcohol intake and consider taking milk thistle or glutathione to support your liver.
2. usCRP is a non specific inflammatory marker. Your level puts you in the average risk category for heart disease. 
3. Your TSH is high suggesting inadequate dosage of your euthyrox, however you recently had it tested before renewing your script and it was fine and you report feeling fine. I suggest repeating it to confirm.
4. Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at 27ng/ml. I would suggest supplementing with 4000iu of vitamin D daily and retest in 4 to 6 months aiming for a level of 5o to 80ng/ml.
5. DHEA level is low - this can happen as we get older but can also be an indication of prolonged stress. Please prioritize rest, relaxation and mindful self-care.
