MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Shamantha Govender
Report Date: 2023-01-27
Doctor: Cindy Smit
Nurse: Ntombikayise Seane
Clinical Recommendations: The tender lump found in the left breast needs to be investigated.  I strongly recommend you go for a mammogram as soon as possible.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Considering your extensive family history of breast and other cancers, I recommend you have a papsmear, mammogram and colonoscopy as soon as possible. Prevention is better than cure!
Overview Notes: During this assessment, we have identified certain concerning aspects which were mentioned previously. You may have noted that lifestyle choices have an enormous impact on your health, and making simple changes can have great benefits!  You are not alone on this journey. Please feel free to contact your Health Care Provider for assistance.  It has been a pleasure providing feedback to you.  I wish you a healthy and happy year ahead!

Special Investigation Notes: 1. Stress ECG: 
baseline variability from the 3rd beat. D/t movement and breathing.  
Slight ST depression in some complexes in V4 and V6, but this occurs with variable baseline and thus cannot be defined as true ST depression.  The ST depression does not occur in contiguous leads and do not occur with each beat.  There is no ST depression or elevations in the following ECGs at 3min and 6min.  
There is an appearance of possible Ventricular tachycardia in V1-V3, but this does not translate globally to all the leads.  The P and T waves come together giving this appearance (P on T phenomena).  The P and T waves can be identified in some of the complexes (The apparent V tach is due to the high HR of 182.)

2. Lung function - poorly performed by patient. Cannot comment. Pt low risk for lung pathology, non-smoker with no respiratory symptoms.
3. Urine dipstick: trace of protein and leukocytes
4. VO2 max fair
5. Body fat % poor

Special Investigation Notes: 1. Stress ECG: 
baseline variability from the 3rd beat. D/t movement and breathing.  
Slight ST depression in some complexes in V4 and V6, but this occurs with variable baseline and thus cannot be defined as true ST depression.  The ST depression does not occur in contiguous leads and do not occur with each beat.  There is no ST depression or elevations in the following ECGs at 3min and 6min.  
There is an appearance of possible Ventricular tachycardia in V1-V3, but this does not translate globally to all the leads.  The P and T waves come together giving this appearance (P on T phenomena).  The P and T waves can be identified in some of the complexes (The apparent V tach is due to the high HR of 182.)

2. Lung function - poorly performed by patient. Cannot comment. Pt low risk for lung pathology, non-smoker with no respiratory symptoms.

The ST depression does not occur in contiguous leads and do not occur with each beat.  There is no ST depression or elevations in the following ECGs at 3min and 6min.  
There is an appearance of possible Ventricular tachycardia in V1-V3, but this does not translate globally to all the leads.  The P and T waves come together giving this appearance (P on T phenomena).  The P and T waves can be identified in some of the complexes (The apparent V tach is due to the high HR of 182.)

Clinical Recommendations: The tender lump found in the left breast needs to be investigated.  I strongly recommend you go for a mammogram as soon as possible.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Considering your extensive family history of breast and other cancers, I recommend you have a papsmear, mammogram and colonoscopy as soon as possible. Prevention is better than cure!
Overview Notes: During this assessment, we have identified certain concerning aspects which were mentioned previously. You may have noted that lifestyle choices have an enormous impact on your health, and making simple changes can have great benefits!  You are not alone on this journey. Please feel free to contact your Health Care Provider for assistance.  It has been a pleasure providing feedback to you.  I wish you a healthy and happy year ahead!

Comment Value: 1. Stress ECG: 
baseline variability from the 3rd beat. D/t movement and breathing.  
Slight ST depression in some complexes in V4 and V6, but this occurs with variable baseline and thus cannot be defined as true ST depression.  The ST depression does not occur in contiguous leads and do not occur with each beat.  There is no ST depression or elevations in the following ECGs at 3min and 6min.  
There is an appearance of possible Ventricular tachycardia in V1-V3, but this does not translate globally to all the leads.
