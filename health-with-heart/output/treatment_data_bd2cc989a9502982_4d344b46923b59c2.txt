Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 24ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. 
2. Moderately raised liver enzyme (GGT) may indicate damage due to medication (epitec) or may also be raised if you have an increased abdominal circumference which may result in a “fatty liver”. You can take milk thistle or glutathione to support your liver. Please discuss with your Dr wrt epitec meds.
3.  Your total cholesterol/LDL cholesterol is above the normal reference range. Before we consider medication make sure you eat a  diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products. Regular exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min is also important. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol and niacin.

Overview Notes: Loyiso overall there were no major concerns identified today. However your vitamin D level is on the low side which can be corrected by supplementing with vitamin D. Your cholesterol is a bit high as is your body fat percentage. Both of these issues can be helped by focusing on you lifestyle - try to eat a healthy mediterranean style diet and exercise frequently. Your one liver enzyme was also slightly raised, possibly due to your medication. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you a wonderful rest of the year.
