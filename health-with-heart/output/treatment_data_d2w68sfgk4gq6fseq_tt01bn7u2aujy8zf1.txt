Comment Value: Roelof, was really nice meeting you. You are very fit and have found a "release" in the exercise. Be mindful of your coffee intake - the combination of stress and excessive amount of caffeine also worsens anxiety.
Please see the cardiologist as directed.
You have a family history of cholesterol and heart disease. Being mindful of your cholesterol rather than avoiding it is important. One form of statin didn't agree with you - a lower dose of a different statin might make a difference. As discussed - please consider the changes we suggested. Repeat the cholesterol levels in 3 months time.
