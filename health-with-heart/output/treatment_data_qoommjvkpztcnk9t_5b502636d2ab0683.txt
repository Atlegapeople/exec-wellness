Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. The FBC (full blood count) showed a low haemoglobin and suggests you have anaemia. The platelets and ESR were raised which may be due to underlying infection or inflammation. Please see your GP for further investigation.
2. Low Vitamin D levels.  Vitamin D is important in several functions eg aiding the immune system, bone/muscle health and improving mood. Vitamin D can increased by eating Vit. D rich food eg. salmon/sardines and by taking supplements.
3. HS CRP (a marker of inflammation) was very high. Inflammation can have multiple causes eg. infection, toxins and underlying disease, but a high cholesterol and obesity can contribute.
4. High cholesterol and LDL. Levels may reduce by limiting refined carbohydrates/sugar, processed food, trans fats and animal product consumption, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
