Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: I am glad to see that you have good cholesterol levels. Your hsCRP marker was raised on your bloods. This can be an indicator of low grade inflammation in your body. Often exacerbated by lifestyle factors (poor diet - high sugar/ processed goods, stress, lack of exercise, poor sleep quality etc.). However your marker may have been raised due to a mild respiratory viral infection at the time your bloods were taken. Your homocysteine levels can also be improved with increasing your vegetable intake (leafy greens).
