Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is low at 19.2ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- High GGT (liver enzyme) - lower this by abstaining from alcohol & foods high in fat. Supplement with Milk thistle extract or Essentiale Extreme to support liver function.
- Reduce your refined carbohydrate and sugar intake in order to lower you fasting insulin.
- High hsCRP: keep in mind that stress and high levels of inflammation can contribute to this. Lower through exercise and dietary control.
