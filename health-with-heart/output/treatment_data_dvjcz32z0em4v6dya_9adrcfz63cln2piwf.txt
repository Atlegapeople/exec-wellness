Overview Notes: Continue with your healthy high fiber diet, probiotics, exercise and adequate water intake to encourage a daily bowel movement. As you are still only going every second day I recommend supplementing with magnesium citrate starting at 300mg and Vit C 1000mg at night to have a gentle natural laxative effect.
