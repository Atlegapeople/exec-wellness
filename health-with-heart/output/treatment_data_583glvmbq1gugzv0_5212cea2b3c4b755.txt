Comment Value: 1. Low Vitamin D levels at 15.  This is optimal closer to 50. Supplement for 3 months and review with your doctor.
2. Decreased kidney filtration (already known by your specialist), keep monitoring with your specialist and with your GP.
3. Increased background inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Chronic illnesses like Lupus will contribute to this but lifestyle adjustments can help decrease this for you. Improve sleep and manage stress where you can. Increase exercise to 3-5x a week.
