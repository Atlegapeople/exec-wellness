MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Tswelopele Kodisang
Report Date: 2022-11-07
Doctor: Melinda Whitfield
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Your general exam did not pick up any red flags. Your systems exam was unremarkable and you appear in general good health. You had one high BP reading. With BP being dynamic and this a snapshot, we need more data - please see note under Vitals.
Men's Health Recommendations: Routine male screening includes review of the prostate gland. Your recent PSA levels (a prostate marker) on your blood work were normal. This screening is important as it helps early detection & management of any irregularities.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Tswelo, it was a pleasure doing your medical & seeing your commitment to good health. There are tweaks to optimise further. You have great variation in blood pressure readings & a 24Hr ABPM is required. I am also concerned about your ECG (despite your warning) & with comments from a previous report as a reference, I would prefer you to consult with a cardiologist again. Please do not hesitate to contact us. Wishing you good health & prosperity into the festive season and new year ahead.

Report Date: 2022-11-07
Doctor: Melinda Whitfield
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You’ve been able to maintain a good weight with regular exercise & a healthy diet. This will reduce your risk for future illness (such a hypertension). Keep going with these lifestyle habits. Your hearing test detected some hearing loss - recommended full audiogram (see report).
Men's Health Recommendations: I suggest that you have a prostate ultrasound as part of routine preventative screening when you hit 50yrs of age. Your PSA was in range and you have no other red flags.

Clinical Recommendations: Your general exam did not pick up any red flags. Your systems exam was unremarkable and you appear in general good health. You had one high BP reading. With BP being dynamic and this a snapshot, we need more data - please see note under Vitals.
Men's Health Recommendations: Routine male screening includes review of the prostate gland. Your recent PSA levels (a prostate marker) on your blood work were normal. This screening is important as it helps early detection & management of any irregularities.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Tswelo, it was a pleasure doing your medical & seeing your commitment to good health. There are tweaks to optimise further. You have great variation in blood pressure readings & a 24Hr ABPM is required.

Please do not hesitate to contact us. Wishing you good health & prosperity into the festive season and new year ahead.

Clinical Recommendations: Your general exam did not pick up any red flags. Your systems exam was unremarkable and you appear in general good health. You had one high BP reading. With BP being dynamic and this a snapshot, we need more data - please see note under Vitals.
Men's Health Recommendations: Routine male screening includes review of the prostate gland. Your recent PSA levels (a prostate marker) on your blood work were normal. This screening is important as it helps early detection & management of any irregularities.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Tswelo, it was a pleasure doing your medical & seeing your commitment to good health. There are tweaks to optimise further. You have great variation in blood pressure readings & a 24Hr ABPM is required. I am also concerned about your ECG (despite your warning) & with comments from a previous report as a reference, I would prefer you to consult with a cardiologist again. Please do not hesitate to contact us. Wishing you good health & prosperity into the festive season and new year ahead.
Comment Key: SpecialInvestigationRecommendation
Comment Value: Abnormal ECG with possible new changes. Please revisit the Cardiologist to establish if anything is concerning. NervIQ was abnormal from a CNS perspective (suggesting sympathetic overdrive) & while I know you use Calm, you need to reset the balance of your autonomic nervous system.

Overview Notes: Tswelo, it was a pleasure doing your medical & seeing your commitment to good health. There are tweaks to optimise further. You have great variation in blood pressure readings & a 24Hr ABPM is required. I am also concerned about your ECG (despite your warning) & with comments from a previous report as a reference, I would prefer you to consult with a cardiologist again. Please do not hesitate to contact us. Wishing you good health & prosperity into the festive season and new year ahead.

Report Date: 2022-11-07
Doctor: Melinda Whitfield
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You’ve been able to maintain a good weight with regular exercise & a healthy diet. This will reduce your risk for future illness (such a hypertension). Keep going with these lifestyle habits. Your hearing test detected some hearing loss - recommended full audiogram (see report).
Men's Health Recommendations: I suggest that you have a prostate ultrasound as part of routine preventative screening when you hit 50yrs of age. Your PSA was in range and you have no other red flags.

Clinical Recommendations: Your general exam did not pick up any red flags. Your systems exam was unremarkable and you appear in general good health. You had one high BP reading. With BP being dynamic and this a snapshot, we need more data - please see note under Vitals.

Men's Health Recommendations: Routine male screening includes review of the prostate gland. Your recent PSA levels (a prostate marker) on your blood work were normal. This screening is important as it helps early detection & management of any irregularities.
