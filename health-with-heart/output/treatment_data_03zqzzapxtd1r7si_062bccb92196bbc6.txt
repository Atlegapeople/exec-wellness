Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - FBC suggests a possible viral infection in the weeks before blood collection.
- hsCRP raised, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have increased. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks. Lower through exercise, weight loss and dietary control.
- Lower "bad" cholesterol by limiting saturated & trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods & replacing refined carbs with those high in fibre. Supplement with Rychol and increase exercise to assist with lowering. Review in 3 months, if no improvement to consider statins.
- Homocysteine level above optimal level. Optimize with methylated B vitamins - Metagenics MethylCare. Repeat level in 6 months.
- High GGT (liver enzyme) - lower this by abstaining from alcohol & salty, fatty foods. Supplement with Milk thistle extract or Essentiale Extreme to support liver function.
