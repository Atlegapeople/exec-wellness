Comment Value: Adrian, lovely meeting you.
As emphasised in our consultation - LIFESTYLE change is the most important take home message.
Your fasting insulin levels were raised and this is usually one of the first signs for insulin resistance and the start of type 2 diabetes.
You can prevent this by loosing weight, eating well, being active and avoiding alcohol.
I would suggest that you repeat the fasting insulin in 3 months time.
Well done on seeing Pippa already - I hope this is the start of healthy change for you.

Comment Value: Adrian, lovely meeting you.
As emphasised in our consultation - LIFESTYLE change is the most important take home message.
Your fasting insulin levels were raised and this is usually one of the first signs for insulin resistance and the start of type 2 diabetes.
You can prevent this by loosing weight, eating well, being active and avoiding alcohol.
I would suggest that you repeat the fasting insulin in 3 months time.
Well done on seeing Pippa already - I hope this is the start of healthy change for you.
