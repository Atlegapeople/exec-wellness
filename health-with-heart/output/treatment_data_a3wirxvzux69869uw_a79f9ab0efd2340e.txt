Comment Value: 1. Normal Vitamin D levels but can be more optimal. Supplement for at least 3 months and review.  2. A mildly reduced kidney filtration may be due to dehydration as you were fasting on the day.  Review the test in 3 months when you are not fasting. 3. One liver enzyme is mildly raised. Avoid frequent alcohol (even if in limits).  4. A raised uric acid will predispose you to gout.  Reduce red meat and alcohol to improve this. 5. Mildly raised LDL cholesterol and raised homocysteine levels, avoid excessive fatty red meat.
