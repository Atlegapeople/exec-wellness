MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:

Employee: DAWID SPANGENBERG
Report Date: 2025-07-31
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Masha Tisetso
Clinical Recommendations: You examine well clinically, with normal vital signs and a healthy BMI. There are no concerning skin lesions at present. I'm glad you've had a Mole Mapping assessment with a Dermatologist — early detection plays a key role in improving outcomes and guiding timely management.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with clinical exams as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: You have a strong baseline and have been building solid healthy habits into your routine, which will go a long way in preventing future chronic conditions and health issues. As with all health journeys, there are always areas we can continue to optimise. 

We can reassess these at your next annual medical. In the meantime, keep up the great work and stay consistent with the positive changes you've made.

Kind regards,
