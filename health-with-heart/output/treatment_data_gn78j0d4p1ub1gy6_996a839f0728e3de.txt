Overview Notes: Batsile, you are in a good mental health state and have a resilient nature. Continue taking care of your mental health as persistent stress can have a negative long-term effect. As previously mentioned, your physical health will benefit from lifestyle adjustments eg. becoming more active and adjusting your diet. These changes will take at least 3 months to show change but persistence is key!
