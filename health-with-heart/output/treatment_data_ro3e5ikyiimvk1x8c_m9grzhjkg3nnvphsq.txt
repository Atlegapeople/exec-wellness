Overview Notes: An increased waist circumference is associated with a higher risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Continue with your active lifestyle and pay attention to your nutrition and stress management. A reduction in alcohol consumption to 1 unit daily (rather than 2 glasses daily) may also help.

Overview Notes: An increased waist circumference is associated with a higher risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Continue with your active lifestyle and pay attention to your nutrition and stress management. A reduction in alcohol consumption to 1 unit daily (rather than 2 glasses daily) may also help. Aim for a waist circumference of 80cm or less.

Overview Notes: An increased waist circumference is associated with a higher risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Continue with your active lifestyle and pay attention to your nutrition and stress management. A reduction in alcohol consumption to 1 unit daily (rather than 2 glasses daily) may also help. Aim for a waist circumference of 80cm or less.
