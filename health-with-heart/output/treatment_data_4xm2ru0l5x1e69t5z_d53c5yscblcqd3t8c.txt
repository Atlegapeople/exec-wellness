Comment Value: Karin, lovely meeting you and thank you for coming for the medical. Majority of your issues stem from bad lifestyle choices. If you address your diet, exercise and stress levels - your cardiovascular risk will decrease, insulin levels will improve and your blood pressure will also improve. I recommend seeing a dietician and a biokineticist to assist you in adressing these.
Hope the rest of 2022 is a healthier one for you.

Comment Value: Karin, lovely meeting you and thank you for coming for the medical. Majority of your issues stem from bad lifestyle choices. If you address your diet, exercise and stress levels - your cardiovascular risk will decrease, insulin levels will improve and your blood pressure will also improve.
