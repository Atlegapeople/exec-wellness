Comment Value: Darshana lovely seeing you again. Apart from the above recommendations you also presented with a tight chest and I prescribed a few things to assist (flixonase, foxair, cetirizine, trustan) If symptoms do not improve - please see a GP. It was also noted that you have an epigastric mass on examination with associated reflux. Please do the abdominal sonar as indicated and follow up with a GP for the result. 
You can achieve quite a few "improvements" if you adjust your lifestyle. I would recommend seeing a dietician and a biokineticist to assist you in eating right for you and doing the correct exercises.
Hope this is the start of a healthier 2022 for you.
