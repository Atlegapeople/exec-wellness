Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal at  21.7ng/ml. Supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. 
- Insulin is normal but higher than optimal level (<6mIU/l).  Reduce your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet as well as incorporate regular exercise into your lifestyle ( 3-5 times a week for 30-60 minutes). Recommend a repeat in 8 weeks. Supplementation with Insumax-Q assists with lowering this.
- Uric acid and liver enzyme GGT is high: limit alcohol intake. Also to reduce uric acid, limit the consumption of purine-rich foods (red or organ meats, shellfish, legumes) & avoid sugar.
- HsCRP is high: indicates risk for cardiovascular disease, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have increased the level up. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks. Lower through exercise, weight loss, & dietary control.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal at  21.7ng/ml. Supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. 
- Insulin is normal but higher than optimal level (<6mIU/l).  Reduce your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet as well as incorporate regular exercise into your lifestyle ( 3-5 times a week for 30-60 minutes). Recommend a repeat in 8 weeks. Supplementation with Insumax-Q assists with lowering this.
- Uric acid and liver enzyme GGT is high: limit alcohol intake. Also to reduce uric acid, limit the consumption of purine-rich foods (red or organ meats, shellfish, legumes) & avoid sugar.
- HsCRP is high: indicates risk for cardiovascular disease, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have increased the level up. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks. Lower through exercise, weight loss, & dietary control.
