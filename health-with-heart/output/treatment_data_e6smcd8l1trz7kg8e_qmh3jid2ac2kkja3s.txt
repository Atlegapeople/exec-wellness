You mentioned you have already significantly reduced red meat. Repeat uric acid level shows improvement (from 0.51mmol/l to 0.44. (Ideal< 0.42). I would encourage diet modification to support this.

Overview Notes: Raised uric acid can cause gout and can be associated with increased cardiac risk. Decreasing alcohol and red meat consumption can help to lower uric acid. You mentioned you have already significantly reduced red meat. Repeat uric acid level shows improvement (from 0.51mmol/l to 0.44. (Ideal< 0.42). I would encourage diet modification to support this.

You mentioned you have already significantly reduced red meat. Repeat uric acid level shows improvement (from 0.51mmol/l to 0.44. (Ideal< 0.42). I would encourage diet modification to support this.

You mentioned you have already significantly reduced red meat. Repeat uric acid level shows improvement (from 0.51mmol/l to 0.44. (Ideal< 0.42). I would encourage diet modification to support this.

Overview Notes: Raised uric acid can cause gout and can be associated with increased cardiac risk. Decreasing alcohol and red meat consumption can help to lower uric acid. You mentioned you have already significantly reduced red meat. Repeat uric acid level shows improvement (from 0.51mmol/l to 0.44. (Ideal< 0.42). I would encourage diet modification to support this.
