Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your low Vit D can be supplemented & levels retested in 3/12. Your cholesterol was found to be high. This can be managed with lifestyle changes (diet/ exercise) however if not adequately controlled you may need to start a low dose medication (statin). Your kidney filtration rate was reduced. This is possibly due to fasting/ dehydration at the time the bloods were taken. However, due to the chronic medication you are taking and the possible effects it may have, this needs to be monitored closely. There were signs of mild anaemia - starting your iron supplement again may help improve these levels.
