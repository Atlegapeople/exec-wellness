Comment Value: - Your vitamin D level is low at  12.6ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. 
- If you regularly eat more calories than you burn, particularly from high-carbohydrate foods, it causes you to have high triglycerides. Choose healthier fats and reduce the consumption of refined carbs to assist with lowering this.
- Homocysteine level (autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Reduce your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet as well as incorporate regular exercise into your lifestyle ( 3-5 times a week for 30-60 minutes) in order to decrease your risk of developing insulin resistance.
