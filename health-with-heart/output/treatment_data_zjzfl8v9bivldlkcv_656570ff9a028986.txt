Comment Value: Your blood work showed signs of improvement with your current lifestyle adjustments you’ve been implementing. Your hsCRP (inflammatory marker), homocysteine (leafy greens), fasting glucose/ insulin - were all sitting at good levels. Your Total Cholesterol was slightly raised. This we can monitor in the next few months and review whether to start an oral lipid-lowering agent. Keep working on your diet (low fat) and regular exercise. Your Vitamin D was also noted to be low. We can supplement this orally and repeat levels in 3/12. Some of your hormone markers were also slightly lowered. We can repeat this on your next blood work and follow-up with our hormone doctor at the practice.
