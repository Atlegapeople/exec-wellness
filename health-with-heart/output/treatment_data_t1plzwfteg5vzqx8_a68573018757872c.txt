MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Devesh Lakman
Report Date: 2023-09-13
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: You have no current concerns on your clinical examination. If any symptoms or signs arise - to seek medical review from your GP.
Men's Health Recommendations: As you get older (>40 years) - routine screening becomes important to help early detection & management of any irregularities. In males, this means regular prostate examinations and PSA blood levels. This is something to bear in mind in the next few years.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: There were a few areas that we identified that can be optimised in order to improve your current general health as well as prevent future chronic illness. Building healthy practices & lifestyle changes can have a big impact. It takes time to develop these habits - but keep going!

You can re-test your blood levels (as discussed above) in 3/12 - in order to monitor for improvement & optimise your management.

Comment Value: 1. Microcystic anaemia - most likely iron deficiency due to recent fasting from meat/ eggs. This can be increased through introducing these foods again or iron supplementation 
2. High cholesterol - Modifications (improved diet & regular frequent exercise) can help control these levels. We can trail supplements (Omega 3 & RyChol) and retest your levels in 3/12. 
3. High fasting insulin - shows risk for developing future diabetes and insulin resistance. Lifestyle medications as discussed are essential & prevent future chronic illness. 
4. Insufficient Vit D levels - to be supplemented & levels retested in 3/12. 
5. Rise in hsCRP - marker for future cardiovascular risk. Nutritious diet changes, improved sleep quality & exercise will help bring this low grade inflammatory level down.

Comment Value: You’ve recently been aiming to improving your exercise. Forming a good weekly routine helps reduce stress & improves sleep quality. Recent fasting in your diet (no meat) has lowered your iron levels (see blood results). Introducing these foods again will help improve these levels.
