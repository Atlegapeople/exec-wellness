Clinical Recommendations: You examined well with no current concerns. Regular breast self-examinations are recommended. If any irregularities noted to follow up with your GP for review.
Your audiology report showed normal hearing.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular screening is important to detect any abnormalities early & improves management. I’m glad to hear your recent Pap Smear was normal & that you received your HPV vaccinations. Mammogram screening normally starts from 40 years.
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline functioning with a few areas that can be optimised. This can have a positive impact on your general health, wellbeing & daily functioning. 

We have taken further bloods (full thyroid function, Vit B12, Folate) & will follow up the results. Your cholesterol was high - to attempt control with lifestyle adjustments otherwise we can start a low dose statin. 

We can see you in 3/12 for review & repeat blood levels.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your bloods showed a macrocytosis & suboptimal homocysteine levels. This is possibly due to low Vit B12 & folate levels. We can test these levels in your blood to correlate the need for treatment. Your low Vit D levels can be supplemented & blood levels rechecked in 3/12.
Your TSH was slight raised. This may be an inductor for thyroid dysfunction - we will repeat a full thyroid blood test & manage accordingly.
Your cholesterol levels were raised. This can possibly be controlled with lifestyle (diet & exercise) changes. We started an Omega 3 supplement. We will repeat levels in 3/12 and determine possible need for starting low dose statin (with your strong family history).

Comment Value: We spoke about your sleep quality & methods to improve it (sleep hygiene). Alcohol can have a big impact of your sleep cycle & reducing intake may have a positive impact. The average recommended alcohol consumption is <14 units spread over a week. Regular exercise also improves sleep.

Clinical Recommendations: You examined well with no current concerns. Regular breast self-examinations are recommended. If any irregularities noted to follow up with your GP for review.
Your audiology report showed normal hearing.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular screening is important to detect any abnormalities early & improves management. I’m glad to hear your recent Pap Smear was normal & that you received your HPV vaccinations. Mammogram screening normally starts from 40 years.
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline functioning with a few areas that can be optimised. This can have a positive impact on your general health, wellbeing & daily functioning. 

We have taken further bloods (full thyroid function, Vit B12, Folate) & will follow up the results. Your cholesterol was high - to attempt control with lifestyle adjustments otherwise we can start a low dose statin. 

We can see you in 3/12 for review & repeat blood levels. 

Warm regards,
Dr Jessica Koen
