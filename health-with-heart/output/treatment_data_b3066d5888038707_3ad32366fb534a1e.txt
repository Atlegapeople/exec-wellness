Clinical Recommendations: You examine well clinically, with normal vital signs and a healthy BMI. There are no concerning skin lesions at present. I'm glad you've had a Mole Mapping assessment with a Dermatologist — early detection plays a key role in improving outcomes and guiding timely management.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate.

Comment Value: Your blood work reflects the healthy lifestyle habits you've been incorporating into your routine. The main finding was a slight increase in your cholesterol levels. This can be managed with dietary adjustments over the next few months, and we’ll plan to recheck your levels next year. Adding an omega-3 and vitamin D supplement can also support your overall health.
