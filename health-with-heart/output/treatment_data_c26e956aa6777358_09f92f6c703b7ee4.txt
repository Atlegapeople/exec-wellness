Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your bloods showed low grade inflammation & raised markers for future cardiovascular risk. There are many factors that increase these levels - such diet (high sugar/ processed foods), alcohol intake, stress & smoking. Building good lifestyle habits (increased variety of vegetables & regular exercise) will help reduce these markers. Your cholesterol levels were slightly raised - we can manage this with lifestyle adjustments but may need to start medication in the future if not controlled. Your low Vit D levels can be supplemented & bloods repeated in 3/12.
