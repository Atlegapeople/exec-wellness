Comment Value: 1. Homocysteine is slightly high; it is a marker to detect eg. heart disease. There are many contributing factors, but it can  improve with lifestyle modification and stress reduction.
2. Your cholesterol is high; this may lead to developing eg. heart disease and stroke.  Limiting consumption of animal products and taking an Omega 3 supplement will aid in reducing the levels.
3. High fasting insulin indicates that you have insulin resistance (this is still reversible). You will benefit from combining intermittent fasting with dietary adjustment and exercise.
