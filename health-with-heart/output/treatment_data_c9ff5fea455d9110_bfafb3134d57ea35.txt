Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal/low at 11ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Your HsCRP (Chronic Inflammatory Marker) was very high at 38.5 mg/l. This puts you in the high risk category for cardiovascular disease. However if you had an infection when the bloods were taken this could have pushed the level up. Stress can also play a role and perhaps in your case your endometriosis. Please repeat the level in 6 weeks. 
3. Your fasting insulin level is very high. This may be an indication of insulin resistance or "pre diabetes"/may just be because you ate a banana pre bloods! It is very important that you reduce the carbs (especially refined ones) and sugar in your diet to a minimum and try to exercise at least five times a week for 30 to 60 minutes. I recommend that you retest in 6 weeks.

Comment Value: Please try to get more sleep! Try to put a limit on what time you work until and then have time to do the things you want to do and to unwind (without screens) so that you can fall asleep more easily and sleep for longer. Consider taking magnesium before bed to assist with sleep.
