Comment Value: 1. Repeat your full blood count in 1-2months. An increased size of red blood cells may be due to a B12 deficiency or frequent alcohol use. 2. Reduced kidney filtration rate. Review this in 2-3months when not fasting (and dehydrated) for other blood tests. 3. A mildly raised liver enzyme could be due to a fatty liver (increased waist circumference) or frequent alcohol use. 4. A raised uric acid will predispose you to frequent gout attacks. Reduce red meat and discuss medication with a doctor if you do have frequent joint pain. 5. Work on your diet again and review your cholesterol in 6 months.  You may need statins to control this. 6.
