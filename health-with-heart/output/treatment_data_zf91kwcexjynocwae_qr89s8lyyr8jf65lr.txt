Comment Value: Roberta, thank you for taking part in the medical, it was a pleasure meeting you. Your fasting insulin levels were raised and this is usually one of the first signs for insulin resistance and the start of type 2 diabetes. You can prevent this by losing weight, eating well, being active and avoiding alcohol.I would suggest that you repeat the fasting insulin in 3 months time.
I believe you have all it take to make the lifestyle changes and live the healthy life you deserve.
