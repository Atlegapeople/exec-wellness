Comment Value: 1.Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 25ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Elevated hsCRP (inflammatory marker) may be due to insulin resistance, carrying extra weight, infection.
3. High fasting insulin levels may indicate prediabetes. The most important factors to address are your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose weight.
4. Slightly raised GGT liver enzyme. This may indicate damage due to alcohol or medication or may be raised if you have an increased abdominal circumference.  Try to lose cm around your waistline. You can also take milk thistle or glutathione to support your liver.

Overview Notes: Edwin a few issues were identified today during your medical. You have high fasting insulin levels, you're carrying extra weight around your abdomen and some abnormalities were noted on your ECG. All of these things put you at higher risk for chronic/cardiovascular disease. I encourage you to follow the above advice to try and reverse and minimise these risks. I wish you a happy and healthy rest of the year.
