Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Very mildly reduced kidney filtration rate.  This often happens when you are dehydrated as a consequence of being fasting for the other tests on the day.  Repeat in 3 months when not fasting. 2. Mildly reduced uric acid levels.  High levels are more worrying as it causes gout. Opt for healthier purine rich foods (for example trout) to improve this but not increase it too much.  Visit a dietician if you are unsure.  Repeat the test in 3-6months.
