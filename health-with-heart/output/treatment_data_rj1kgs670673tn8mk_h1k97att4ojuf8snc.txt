Overview Notes: Moderately raised cholesterol levels. The level has gone up a bit since stopping Zuvamor. Discuss with Dr Skye if she is still happy with this. Based on very low inflammatory marker (hsCRP), it is unlikely that the levels are high risk. Continue to focus on lifestyle, mediterranean style diet, exercise and stress management.

Comment Value: Current medical concerns include reflux, hypertension (well controlled), raised cholesterol and osteoarthritis of your knees. Since stopping Zuvamor yout cholesterol levels have gone up a bit however you have very low inflammation levels, which is a good thing. Please discuss with your GP but I'm happy for you to continue to manage your cholesterol through lifestyle, diet, exercise and supplementation with omega 3 and rychol and monitor your levels. Overall your blood results were good with the only abnormal levels being your cholesterol. . Stress management is also of utmost importance but is often difficult to do. Consider meditation, deep breathing exercises and getting outdoors into nature, spending time with family and doing the things that you enjoy.
