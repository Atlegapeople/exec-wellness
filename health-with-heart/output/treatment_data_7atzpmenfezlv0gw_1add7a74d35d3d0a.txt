Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - FBC shows signs of hypochromic anaemia. It would be beneficial to do further blood tests to check iron levels & treat appropriately. Eating an overall healthy diet rich in dark, leafy greens, nuts & seeds, seafood, beans, & vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables can help you get the iron you need to manage anaemia.
- Continue supplementing with Vitamin D3 daily & repeat in 6 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml.
- Lower cholesterol by limiting saturated & trans fats, consuming omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods & replacing refined carbs with those high in fibre. Supplement with Rychol to assist with lowering.
- Keep fasting insulin in the recommended range (<6mIU/l) by reducing your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet.
- hsCRP raised: having an infection in the past couple of weeks could raise levels. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks. Lower through exercise, weight loss & dietary control.
