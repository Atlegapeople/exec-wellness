Comment Value: Bianca it was lovely to meet you and do your medical today. The main concerns that we discussed today were your weight and raised fasting insulin. We know that you may have a genetic predisposition but as mentioned diabetes is very much a lifestyle disease and we can do a lot to prevent that happening. Please focus on the dietary changes we discussed and consider seeing a dietician. Repeat fasting glucose, fasting insulin, vitamin d and hscrp in February next year. I hope that you have a wonderful and healthy festive season and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
