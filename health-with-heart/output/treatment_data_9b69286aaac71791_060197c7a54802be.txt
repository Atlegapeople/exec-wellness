Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: ESR 31: slightly raised - can be explained by your upper respiratory tract infection at the time.
Vit D suboptimal: Please supplement with Vit D3 1000iu daily and repeat the levels in 3/12. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
Your ultra-sensitive CRP was raised at 51. However you also had an upper respiratory tract infection at the time of doing the bloods. 
DHEA is low - you are spending a lot of your time in "fight and flight". Please prioritize rest, relaxation and mindful self-care. Prolonged exposure to stress hormones affects cognition, mood and performance as well as increasing your risk of chronic diseases. Cold showers and walking barefoot on grass as discussed. Repeat the levels in 3/12 and then you can see if you want to supplement with DHEA
