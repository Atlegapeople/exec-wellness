Comment Value: Kobie, it was really nice meeting you. There are quite a few things to do and lifestyle changes will make a massive difference in your energy levels and longevity. 
Your hearing was noted to be slightly abnormal. Left ear is within normal limits. The right ear has a mild 'notch' at 4000Hz. It is suggested to monitor
hearing annually, unless you are struggling, in which case a full audiogram
is recommended. Hope 2022 is a healthier year for you.
