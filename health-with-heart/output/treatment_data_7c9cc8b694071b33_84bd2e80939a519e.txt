Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Urea was slightly raised - please take in adequate amount of water and review when you see Dr Magan again. 
2. Raised hs-CRP - you have ongoing low grade inflammatory levels due to your autoimmune diseases. If you manage these well, this will decrease
3. Vit D 36 - continue supplementing with the Calciferol and see the attached Glossary for the benefits of having a good Vit D level.
4. DHEA level is 1.2. Trying to actively "rest and digest" is important. We spoke about walking on grass barefoot, taking cold showers and practicing mindfulness. Review with Dr Magan if you should be replacing.
