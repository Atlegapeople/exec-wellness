Comment Value: Jan, thank you for coming for your medical. We picked up quite a few areas of concern.
You need to be initiated on BP treatment - so please make a booking with your GP to facilitate this as well as registering you for chronic on your medical aid.
Your Cholesterol is raised, and require treatment as well and can be done in the same visit.
Treating both of these will decrease your cardiovascular risk.
Upon examining your ears - I saw polyps in your ear canal - your Audio screen is also abnormal - please make a booking to see an ENT
Your homocysteine and hs-CRP is raised - lifestyle changes are required. Seeing a dietician is not a bad idea, move more, loose weight.
It is also prudent to have a review of your Asthma treatment with a Physician.
I know it is a lot, but please start with the sonars, BP and GP review with the results first.
Then start ticking the things off your list. 
Good luck! Hope the rest of 2022 is a healthier one for you.
