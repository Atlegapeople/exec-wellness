Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Insulin: You have a family history of Diabetes and you make poor diet and lifestyle decisions pushing you more towards Diabetes. Lifestyle change needed ASAP. Dietician referral, Biokineticist referral.
- DHEA: Spending too much time in "fight or flight" can cause your DHEA to be low. Practice mindfulness, walking barefoot on grass, breathing exercises can all assist in "resting and digesting"
- Cholesterol: Dietary changes and exercising 4 times a week as discussed. Omega 3 supplementation. Repeat levels in 6/12
- Ultra-sensitive CRP: Aim for a level of less than 1. Low levels of inflammation put you at risk of cardiovascular events in the future. Move more, eat better.
