Comment Value: 1. HS CRP (an inflammatory marker) was high. Inflammation can have many causes eg. auto-immune disease and underlying infection. 
2. Total Cholesterol and LDL was high. Levels may reduce by limiting refined carbohydrates/sugar, trans fats and animal product consumption, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. Please consider seeing a Dietician. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
3. The TSH was elevated and suggests your thyroid medication dose needs to be adjusted (which was recently done by your Rheumatologist). Please continue following up with your specialist for monitoring and management.
