Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function. This needs to be discussed in a follow up appointment with myself or your GP.

Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function.

Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function. This needs to be discussed in a follow up appointment with myself or your GP.

Overview Notes: Try to lose some weight to reduce your risk for chronic disease. As mentioned, abdominal fat is especially risky so aim for a waist circumference of less than 94cm.
Comment Key: MedicalHistoryNote
Comment Value: Mark you mentioned big life decisions causing some recent stress. Despite this your overall chronic health is improving and you have been resilient as evident by your energy and gratitude for life. Your blood pressure is normal and you are not diabetic or insulin resistant. Your Hs-CRP (signifying background levels of inflammation) is low but your homocysteine is on the high side and you should consider taking MethylCare. Addressing diet has lowered your total cholesterol from the previous fasting lipogram test. Add more exercise back in to your routine and your total cholesterol should improve to near normal. A main concern is that your TSH was suggesting abnormal thyroid functions. We should monitor this for you in one month. It was a pleasure doing your medical today and look forward to seeing you again next year.

Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function. This needs to be discussed in a follow up appointment with myself or your GP.

Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function. This needs to be discussed in a follow up appointment with myself or your GP.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function. This needs to be discussed in a follow up appointment with myself or your GP.

Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function. This needs to be discussed in a follow up appointment with myself or your GP.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Your bloods indicate that your thyroid gland is underfunctioning ("hypothyroidism"). I recommend that you take a small dose of thyroid replacement therapy as well as ensuring you get enough vitamin D, selenium, iodine and zinc (which will be covered by the phytomulti) to support the thyroid function. This needs to be discussed in a follow up appointment with myself or your GP.
