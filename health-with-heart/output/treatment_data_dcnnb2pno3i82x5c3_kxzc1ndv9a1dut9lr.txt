Comment Value: Miempie - it was a pleasure meeting you. We isolated a few things that require your attention. Apart from the above "flags" it is very important that you stop smoking. 
Also important to address your joint pains so that you can get moving again.
Being more active, eating healthy (decreasing coke and sugar intake) and smoking cessation will make a big difference in longevity and staying healthy going forward.
