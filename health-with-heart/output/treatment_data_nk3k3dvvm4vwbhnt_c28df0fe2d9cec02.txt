Comment Value: - Vitamin D: Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily and recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Your homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but slightly above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Your HsCRP (chronic inflammatory marker) is at 1.7mg/l. 
This puts you at an average risk for cardiovascular disease. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks. Lower through exercise and a healthier diet.
