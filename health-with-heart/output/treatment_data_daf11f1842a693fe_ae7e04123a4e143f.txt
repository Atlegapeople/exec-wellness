MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: THIYAGRAJAN SIVALINGUM
Report Date: 2025-07-21
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Masha Tisetso
Clinical Recommendations: You appear generally well, though your BMI and body fat percentage are above the ideal range. Continuing with the lifestyle changes we discussed will help bring these levels down and maintain them within a healthier range.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, we identified a few areas that require monitoring and follow-up. We’ve started a statin for your cholesterol and a vitamin D supplement, and we’ll repeat your blood work in 3–4 months to ensure these are well controlled. We also discussed seeing a dietician and going for a screening colonoscopy. 

Some aspects of your lifestyle may increase your risk for future chronic illness and complications. Developing and maintaining healthy habits is key to reducing this risk. Change takes time, but small, consistent steps can create a big impact on your long-term health and well-being. You’re already making progress, and building on these habits will strengthen your results.

We’ll review again in the new year to assess your progress, repeat blood tests, and address any areas that still need attention.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Clinical Recommendations: You appear generally well, though your BMI and body fat percentage are above the ideal range. Continuing with the lifestyle changes we discussed will help bring these levels down and maintain them within a healthier range.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, we identified a few areas that require monitoring and follow-up. We’ve started a statin for your cholesterol and a vitamin D supplement, and we’ll repeat your blood work in 3–4 months to ensure these are well controlled. We also discussed seeing a dietician and going for a screening colonoscopy. 

Some aspects of your lifestyle may increase your risk for future chronic illness and complications. Developing and maintaining healthy habits is key to reducing this risk. Change takes time, but small, consistent steps can create a big impact on your long-term health and well-being. You’re already making progress, and building on these habits will strengthen your results.

Comment Value: Your blood work showed some early warning signs for potential future metabolic concerns. Your cholesterol was elevated, so we have started medication for this (see separate email). Your fasting insulin was also raised, suggesting early insulin resistance. Adopting healthy lifestyle habits now is important to prevent these risks from progressing and to reduce the chance of future complications. We will follow up on your treatment and repeat your blood tests in the new year to ensure we are on track.

Clinical Recommendations: You appear generally well, though your BMI and body fat percentage are above the ideal range. Continuing with the lifestyle changes we discussed will help bring these levels down and maintain them within a healthier range.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, we identified a few areas that require monitoring and follow-up. We’ve started a statin for your cholesterol and a vitamin D supplement, and we’ll repeat your blood work in 3–4 months to ensure these are well controlled. We also discussed seeing a dietician and going for a screening colonoscopy. 

Some aspects of your lifestyle may increase your risk for future chronic illness and complications. Developing and maintaining healthy habits is key to reducing this risk. Change takes time, but small, consistent steps can create a big impact on your long-term health and well-being. You’re already making progress, and building on these habits will strengthen your results.

We’ll review again in the new year to assess your progress, repeat blood tests, and address any areas that still need attention.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen
