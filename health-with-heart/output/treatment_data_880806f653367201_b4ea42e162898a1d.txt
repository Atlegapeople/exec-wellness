Clinical Recommendations: The dry patch of skin on your inner thigh looks like eczema, which gets exacerbated in the dry months of winter. Try to keep it moisturised and apply a steroid cream like locoid or dovate.
Men's Health Recommendations: You are due for a follow up with Dr Venter your urologist.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Guillaume overall you seem to be in excellent health. There were no major issues identified today. We did discuss how stress is impacting your sleep. I would encourage you to try and avoid all screens at least an hour before bed, take a relaxing bath, get into bed relaxed and try and do some deep breathing/mindfulness meditation. You can also try the melatonin&magnesium before bed. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

Comment Key: SymptomScreeningRecommendation
Comment Value: I recommend that you consider doing x-rays of your hands to see if you have arthritis and to see a hand occupational therapist. Omega 3 supplements and MSM can also help with joint pain. Try a steroid cream like locoid lipocream on the eczema on your inner thigh.
