Comment Value: 1. Renal function was slightly impaired. A repeat test is advised when you are well hydrated.
2. GGT (a liver enzyme) was elevated. There are several possible causes including certain medications or medical conditions.
3. The Cholesterol was high (Total cholesterol, LDL and Triglycerides). Limit animal products, saturated/trans fats, refined carbs and sugar. 
4. HS CRP (an inflammatory marker) was slightly high (but in acceptable ranges). Any factor that causes an  inflammatory response can cause elevation of this marker.
5. High fasting Insulin levels indicates you have Insulin Resistance (which is a precursor for Diabetes). This is still reversible!
Please consult your Doctor for repeat testing and further evaluation/management.
