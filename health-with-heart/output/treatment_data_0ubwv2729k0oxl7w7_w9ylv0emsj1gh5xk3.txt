Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: You need to reduce the sugar and refined carbs in your diet, increase your physical activity and loose weight to try and stop the potential for developing diabetes. I would visit your GP to do a fasting insulin test and a post prandial insulin and glucose test to see if there is any resistance developing, especially if you struggle to lose weight after trying.

I would visit your GP to do a fasting insulin test and a post prandial insulin and glucose test to see if there is any resistance developing, especially if you struggle to lose weight after trying.

Overview Notes: You need to reduce the sugar and refined carbs in your diet, increase your physical activity and loose weight to try and stop the potential for developing diabetes. I would visit your GP to do a fasting insulin test and a post prandial insulin and glucose test to see if there is any resistance developing, especially if you struggle to lose weight after trying.

Exercise is important for helping with every aspect of your health.

I would visit your GP to do a fasting insulin test and a post prandial insulin and glucose test to see if there is any resistance developing, especially if you struggle to lose weight after trying.

Comment Value: It was lovely to see you for your medical and there are lots of areas that you can work on to help with feeling stronger and healthier with less joint pain and improved headaches. Please consider the things we have discussed and make definitive plans to work towards a healthier lifestyle that includes exercise and weight loss. A regular follow up with a dietitian will help to keep you motivated, the weight loss is imperative to reducing risk for diabetes and inflammatory related disorders specifically. Supporting your liver should help with your sensitivities and migraines, hopefully the supplements I have suggested will help.
Your joint pain and high CRP point to an increase in inflammation this means that omega 3 supplements may be very beneficial.
You are up to date with your mammograms and pap smears, please continue monthly self breast exams and keep and eye on your moles with your GP. At the age of 50 it is recommended that you do a Colonoscope and Gastro Scope to screen for colon cancers.
Keep well and I look forward to hearing how you manage to put into practice the recommendations I have made.

Overview Notes: You need to reduce the sugar and refined carbs in your diet, increase your physical activity and loose weight to try and stop the potential for developing diabetes. I would visit your GP to do a fasting insulin test and a post prandial insulin and glucose test to see if there is any resistance developing, especially if you struggle to lose weight after trying.

Overview Notes: You need to reduce the sugar and refined carbs in your diet, increase your physical activity and loose weight to try and stop the potential for developing diabetes. I would visit your GP to do a fasting insulin test and a post prandial insulin and glucose test to see if there is any resistance developing, especially if you struggle to lose weight after trying.

Overview Notes: You have a very busy lifestyle and its difficult to add physical activity into your daily routine. Suggestions we discussed are buy a rebounder to do 10-20 min at home daily, looking for a Pilates and bounce class in your area or getting a personal trainer to come to your house. Exercise is important for helping with every aspect of your health.

Overview Notes: You need to reduce the sugar and refined carbs in your diet, increase your physical activity and loose weight to try and stop the potential for developing diabetes. I would visit your GP to do a fasting insulin test and a post prandial insulin and glucose test to see if there is any resistance developing, especially if you struggle to lose weight after trying.
