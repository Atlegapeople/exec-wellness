Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal/low at 19 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
2. Your total cholesterol/LDL cholesterol: Before we consider medication make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar and refined carbs (Mediterranean style diet).  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for 30 min is also important.  We usually give these interventions a good 3-6months before we review. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg and Glucochol22.
3. Your HsCRP (Chronic Inflammatory Marker) was slightly above optimal at 2.7 mg/l. This puts you in the ave risk category for cardiovascular disease. Please keep an eye on BP & cholesterol.
