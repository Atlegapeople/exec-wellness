Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. The FBC showed that the red blood cell count and concentration is slightly elevated. This is likely due to your smoking history, but may be due to dehydration. The test can be repeated in 2-3 months when you are well hydrated.
2. Vitamin D levels are sufficient but suboptimal at 22 ng/ml. Optimal Vit D levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Take a good vitamin D3 supplement of at least 2000 IU daily for 3 months and increase intake of Vit D rich foods eg oily fish.
3. Low cortisol level is likely due to recent cortisone use when you had flu, but may be due to other causes. The test can be repeated in 2-3 months.
