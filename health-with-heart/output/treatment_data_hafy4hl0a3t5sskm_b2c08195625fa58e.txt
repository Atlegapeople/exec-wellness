Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. FBC showed a slight reduction of the white blood cells. This is consistent with a recent viral infection. The test does not need to be repeated.
2. The renal function was slightly impaired and is likely due to dehydration (you were fasted when the test was done). 
The test may be repeated in 3 months (when you are well hydrated).
3. Your Vitamin D levels are sufficient but suboptimal at 24 ng/ml. Optimal Vit D levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Take a good vitamin D3 supplement of at least 2000 IU daily for 3 months and increase intake of Vit D rich foods eg oily fish
4. High urate levels - This is a risk factor for gout and heart disease. Limit purine rich foods/drinks, alcohol and red meat.
5. HS CRP (a marker of inflammation) was very high. Inflammation can have multiple causes eg. infection, auto-immune disease, poor diet, alcohol, smoking etc. In your case the very high levels are likely due to the flu you've recently had.
Special Investigation Notes: Rest ECG:
Reported as sinus bradycardia with patient being hypertensive and having LVH.
Pt not hypertensive (BP slightly high before resting ECG was done, but normal when he came to rooms).
Does not meet voltage or non-voltage criteria for LVH
