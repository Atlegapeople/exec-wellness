Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D is normal at 21 but can be more optimal close to 50. Supplement for 3 months and review with your doctor.
2. Kidney filtration rate mildly decreased often as a result of being dehydrated after fasting on the day. Repeat with a next opportunity to monitor a trend.
3. LDL ("bad") cholesterol and triglycerides mildly raised. Reduce red meat to 1-2x a week and refined sugar/carbs and review with a doctor 6 months.
4. Due to a current viral infection your high ultra sensitive CRP cannot be used to infer inflammation from your lifestyle. You can repeat the test when well again to assess this.
5. Vegetables rich in B-vitamins and folate will reduce your homocysteine levels (a cardiovascular risk marker).
