Comment Value: Isabel - lovely meeting you. Thank you for coming for you medical. You need to be worked up for a ?multi-systemic disease. You have had multiple MRI's, blood tests and a bone marrow with no answer so far. 
The most important thing is to adress this at the moment.
I discussed the options with your Orthopaedic Surgeon - we are in agreement that a Physician review is important. His office will make an appointment with Dr Adler's office and to see him again as you need a repeat scan of your Humerus/wrist.
Please don't delay these consults.
Good luck! I hope you find an answer soon.
