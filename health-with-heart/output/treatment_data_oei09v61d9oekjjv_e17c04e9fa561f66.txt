Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Mild anemia on full blood count. Make sure you are getting enough iron in your diet and follow through with the recommended chronic screens.
2. Vitamin D can be more optimal close to 50. Supplement for 3 months and review.
3. Mild decreased filtration of kidneys often due to being fasting on the day. High blood pressure and chronic medications can affect this. Follow up with a non-fasting blood test in 2-3months.
4. Raised uric acid. Worsened by alcohol and red meat. If you get acute joint pain visit a doctor - it may be gout!
5. Raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Pay attention to good sleep, stress management and adequate exercise to help bring this down.
6. Raised homocysteine. Veggies rich in B-vitamins will help bring this down.
7. Raised fasting insulin. Mind muscle building exercise, make sure your cardio is at sufficient intensity. Avoid refined starchy and sugary foods.
