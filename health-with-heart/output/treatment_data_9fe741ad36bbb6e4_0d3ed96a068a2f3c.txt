Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - HsCRP (chronic inflammatory marker) is at 6.9 mg/l. 
This puts you at high risk for cardiovascular disease, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have increased the level up. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks.
- Your vitamin D level is low at 12ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily and recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Your homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months
