Comment Value: Taryn it was a pleasure meeting you! You are adjusting to the new role as a working mom and it can be a struggle - but you are doing brilliantly. You make healthy lifestyle choices. Apart from a slightly raised cholesterol level, your blood results look good. We spoke a bit about longevity and reading "Younger for Longer". Good to have this perspective if we are making choices for ourselves and our children.
You are very good with your screening - continue doing all your necessary follow ups annually.
Hope 2022 is a healthy year for you!
