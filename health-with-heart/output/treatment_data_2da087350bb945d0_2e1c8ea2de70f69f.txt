Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly pale red cells - possible iron deficiency. Please check iron levels.
2. Very low vitamin D level - supplement with vitamin D3 5000iu daily and recheck level in 4 to 6 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.

4. High total/LDL cholesterol and high triglycerides. Start with lifestyle modification - reduce refined carbs and fruit juice and start to exercise. Recheck annually.
5. Low HDL cholesterol - increase exercise and consider supplementing with omega 3.
6. Insulin levels are normal but above optimal - reduce refined carbs, sugar, fruit and increase exercise.
7. Your thyroid may be slightly underactive - please check thyroid hormone levels.
