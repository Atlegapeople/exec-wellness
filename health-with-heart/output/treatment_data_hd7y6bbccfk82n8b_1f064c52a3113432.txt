Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal/low at 19.9ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml.
- Homocysteine is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare. Repeat in 6 months.
- Your “bad” cholesterol and triglycerides are high. Limit saturated & trans fats, add omega 3 fatty acids, eat more plant-based foods & replace refined carbs with those high in fibre.
- Optimize insulin by reducing your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet as well as incorporating regular exercise into your lifestyle ( 3-5 times a week for 30-60 minutes). Recommend a repeat in 6 weeks.
- Low cortisol may be an indication of burn out. Consider breathing techniques, meditation & supplementation with Ashwaganda/Rhodiola. Eat healthy, get enough sleep & exercise to correct this. Repeat in 1 month.
