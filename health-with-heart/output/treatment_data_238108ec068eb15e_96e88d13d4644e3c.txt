Comment Value: Your Low Vit D levels can be supplemented & blood levels repeated in 3/12. The single finding of high triglyceride levels can possibly be due to increased weight & diet. You reported having a bad nights sleep & feeling slightly unwell when your blood panel was taken. This may have increased your low grade inflammatory markers. In general - weight loss, low sugar, good sleep hygiene & exercise help to reduce inflammatory levels in the body. Your cortisol was slightly raised for the time of day it was taken. This is likely physiological. We can monitor for any further concerning symptoms - otherwise stress reduction & good sleep quality should improve this.

Women's Health Recommendations: You are due for another Pap Smear screening. I am so glad to hear that your last results were normal. You have a maternal history of possible gynaecological cancer concern. Regular screening helps early detection of any irregularities and improves management outcomes.
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline of building good habits into your lifestyle. We discussed a few areas that can be optimised. Sleep quality, regular exercise & a healthy diet show many benefits. This will help improve your general well-being & long term health outcomes. 

We can repeat your blood pressure in 1/12 & review any further concerning symptoms that may arise. 

You've been finding helpful ways of reducing stress - keep going!
