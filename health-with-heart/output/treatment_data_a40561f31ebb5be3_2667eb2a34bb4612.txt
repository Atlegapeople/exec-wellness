Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Raised ESR on full blood count - sign of inflammation.
2. Slightly raised liver enzymes - suggestive of a "fatty liver" commonly seen with insulin resistance. Supplementing with milk thistle and or glutathione can help support liver function.
3. Slightly raised total cholesterol/LDL - continue with lipostat and lifestyle modification.
4. Low HDL cholesterol - increase the amount of exercise you are doing and take omega 3.
5. hsCRp (inflammatory marker) level falls within average risk category for chronic disease. This can be due to insulin resistance.
6. Fasting glucose is at upper limit of normal and fasting insulin is high - continue with metformin, low carb diet and exercise.
