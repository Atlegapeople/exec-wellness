Report Date: 2022-10-21
Doctor: Christie Pilossof
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Your clinical examination was unremarkable, with no concerning findings. Regular mole-mapping with a dermatologist is recommended to screen for any suspicious lesions. Early detection of irregularities can significantly improve management outcomes.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular prostate screening, including PSA testing and clinical exams, becomes increasingly important with age. Your recent PSA levels (prostate marker) were normal, and you report no concerning symptoms. We will continue with routine screening.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Dario overall you seem to be in good health and nice and relaxed after your sabbatical. There is some improvement in many of your results. The only thing that I would really point out from today is to watch the sugar and alcohol in your diet as your insulin is above optimal levels. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular prostate screening, including PSA testing and clinical exams, becomes increasingly important with age. Your recent PSA levels (prostate marker) were normal, and you report no concerning symptoms. We will continue with routine screening.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Dario overall you seem to be in good health and nice and relaxed after your sabbatical. There is some improvement in many of your results. The only thing that I would really point out from today is to watch the sugar and alcohol in your diet as your insulin is above optimal levels. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

Comment Value: 1. Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at 39ng/ml - consider spending some time in the sun and or taking 1000iu of vit D3 daily.
2. Your fasting insulin is above optimal (but within normal). High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. The most important factors to address are your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and keep your stress down.
3. Your total cholesterol/LDL are marginally raised. I am not concerned as your inflammation is nice and low and you don't have additional risk factors.

Comment Value: 1. Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at 39ng/ml - consider spending some time in the sun and or taking 1000iu of vit D3 daily.
2. Your fasting insulin is above optimal (but within normal). High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. The most important factors to address are your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and keep your stress down.
3. Your total cholesterol/LDL are marginally raised. I am not concerned as your inflammation is nice and low and you don't have additional risk factors.

Clinical Recommendations: Normal examination on the day.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular prostate screening, including PSA testing and clinical exams, becomes increasingly important with age. Your recent PSA levels (prostate marker) were normal, and you report no concerning symptoms. We will continue with routine screening.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Dario overall you seem to be in good health and nice and relaxed after your sabbatical. There is some improvement in many of your results. The only thing that I would really point out from today is to watch the sugar and alcohol in your diet as your insulin is above optimal levels. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular prostate screening, including PSA testing and clinical exams, becomes increasingly important with age. Your recent PSA levels (prostate marker) were normal, and you report no concerning symptoms. We will continue with routine screening.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Dario overall you seem to be in good health and nice and relaxed after your sabbatical. There is some improvement in many of your results. The only thing that I would really point out from today is to watch the sugar and alcohol in your diet as your insulin is above optimal levels. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

Overview Notes: Dario overall you seem to be in good health and nice and relaxed after your sabbatical. There is some improvement in many of your results. The only thing that I would really point out from today is to watch the sugar and alcohol in your diet as your insulin is above optimal levels. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular prostate screening, including PSA testing and clinical exams, becomes increasingly important with age. Your recent PSA levels (prostate marker) were normal, and you report no concerning symptoms. We will continue with routine screening.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Dario overall you seem to be in good health and nice and relaxed after your sabbatical. There is some improvement in many of your results. The only thing that I would really point out from today is to watch the sugar and alcohol in your diet as your insulin is above optimal levels. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.

Doctor: Christie Pilossof
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular prostate screening, including PSA testing and clinical exams, becomes increasingly important with age. Your recent PSA levels (prostate marker) were normal, and you report no concerning symptoms. We will continue with routine screening.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Dario overall you seem to be in good health and nice and relaxed after your sabbatical. There is some improvement in many of your results. The only thing that I would really point out from today is to watch the sugar and alcohol in your diet as your insulin is above optimal levels. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022 and I look forward to seeing you again next year.
