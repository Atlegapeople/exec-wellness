Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. FBC showed slightly raised haemoglobin, red cell count and haematocrit. This may be due to dehydration or other causes. Slightly low white cell count and monocytes can be due to recent infection. The FBC can be repeated in 8-12 weeks when you are well hydrated.
2. Low Vitamin D levels.  Vitamin D is important in several functions eg. immunity, bone/muscle health, sleep and improving mood. Levels can improve by eating Vitamin D rich food and by taking a good supplement.
3. Very high cholesterol and LDL. Levels may reduce by limiting refined carbohydrates/sugar, trans fats and animal product consumption, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. Lifestyle modification is always recommended even when your Dr. advises you to start on medication. Please consider seeing a Dietician. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
