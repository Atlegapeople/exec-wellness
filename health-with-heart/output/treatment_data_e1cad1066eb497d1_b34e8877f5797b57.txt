Overview Notes: 5. Your homocysteine is high at 14umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
Dora overall you seem to be in relatively good health. Please try to increase your activity levels and optimise your vitamin B & D levels. I would encourage you to go for a mammogram based on your age.  It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you a happy & healthy year further.
