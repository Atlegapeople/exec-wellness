Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 28.5ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 2000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Mildly reduced kidney function. This would not be considered pathological unless it persists for more than 3 months and there is protein present in your urine. Please retest as discussed.
3.Total/LDL cholesterol mildly raised. Follow a healthy diet with lots of veg,  decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min is also important. Supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg.
4. Normal fasting insulin but optimal would be less than 5. Reduce refined carbs and increase exercise.
5. Cortisol levels on the high side of normal which is not surprising considering your stress levels. I would encourage you to go back to your mindfulness practice.

Overview Notes: Kim overall there were no major concerns identified today. However I would like you to repeat your kidney function and monitor your cholesterol annually. Your stress levels are high which was also reflected in your relatively high cortisol level. I would encourage you to return to your mindfulness practice and take time to rest and relax. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you a happy and healthy 2023.
