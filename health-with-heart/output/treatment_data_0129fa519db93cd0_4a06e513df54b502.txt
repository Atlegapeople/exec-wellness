MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Christopher De Kock
Report Date: 2022-06-30
Doctor: Christie Pilossof
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Normal clinical examination on the day
Men's Health Recommendations: You previously went for a colonoscopy about 4 years ago and everything was normal. Consider a repeat colonoscopy in a year's time. Based on your age, it is advised to see a urologist to check your prostate.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Chris, overall you are very fit and have a generally healthy lifestyle. 
There are a few things mentioned in the report that you can address for optimal health but my  two main concerns picked up are:
1) Homocysteine very high - this can be corrected by taking actively methylated B vitamins such as Metagenics MethylCare which I recommended to you.
2) Your resting ECG suggests a possible enlargement of the right atrium of your heart. Given your previous history of palpitations/arrhythmia, I would strongly encourage you to follow up with your cardiologist.
It was a pleasure to do your medical today, and I look forward to seeing you again next year. I wish you a wonderful second half of 2022.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is very high at 34.8! We need to bring this down by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Metagenics MethylCare (Wellness Warehouse/Faithful to Nature) & recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for <7umol/l.
Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 31ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3months. Aim for a level of 50 to 80ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
Your HsCRP (Chronic Inflammatory Marker) was slightly above optimal at 2. This puts you in the ave risk category for cardiovascular disease. Please keep an eye on BP & cholesterol.

1) Homocysteine very high - this can be corrected by taking actively methylated B vitamins such as Metagenics MethylCare which I recommended to you.
2) Your resting ECG suggests a possible enlargement of the right atrium of your heart. Given your previous history of palpitations/arrhythmia, I would strongly encourage you to follow up with your cardiologist.
It was a pleasure to do your medical today, and I look forward to seeing you again next year. I wish you a wonderful second half of 2022.

Comment Key: SpecialInvestigationRecommendation
Comment Value: Abnormal resting ECG - please book a consult with your cardiologist for an echocardiogram. In light of your palpitations and high heart rate when cycling and now some abnormalities on your ECG, I think this is a priority.
Your NervIQ report suggests you are pushing into sympathetic (fight or flight) overdrive. Please prioritise rest, relaxation and mindful self-care.
