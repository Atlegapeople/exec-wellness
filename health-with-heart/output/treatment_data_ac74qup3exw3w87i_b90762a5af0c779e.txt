Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal at  21ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily and repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Homocysteine level is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Recommend Metagenics MethylCare. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Your “bad” cholesterol is high. Limit saturated & trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods & replacing refined carbs with those high in fibre. Supplement with Glucochol22 or Rychol to support.
- HsCRP above optimal level - exercise & a healthy diet should reduce this.
- Uric acid is high: reduce purine rich foods (red or organ meats, shellfish, legumes), avoid sugar, limit alcohol intake & drink more water.
