Comment Value: Aubrey it was a pleasure meeting you. Most of your issues can be adressed by improving your lifestyle. Being more active and eating better can make a very big difference. There is a dietician available at the Wellness Centres if you would want advice. Biokineticist is also helpful in helping you move better safely.
I referred you for extra blood tests - we saw a raised Ferritin level and a low phosphate level. There can be a few reasons for this. The Colonoscopy will also help to exclude Gluten intolerance as this can cause malabsorption as well.
