Comment Key: MentalHealthNote
Comment Value: Sometimes feels anxious about work and future. Says she stresses quickly, but it does not affect her work or personal life. 

Work mostly causes stress. This resolves when the deadlines are met/work is complete. Had periods of feeling overwhelmed in February when they had lot of work, but this resolved when work complete. 
She copes by compartmentalizing and getting work done.
