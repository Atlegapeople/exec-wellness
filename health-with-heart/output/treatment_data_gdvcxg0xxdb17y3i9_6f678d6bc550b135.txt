Women's Health Recommendations: Your report being up-to-date with your medical screening. I am so glad to hear that your latest Mammogram and Pap Smear were clear. Regular screening helps to detect any abnormalities early and improves management outcomes.
Overview Notes: Overall, you have been making a lot of positive changes in your lifestyle - which has shown on your investigations. Keep going! It's challenging but worth it in the long run. 

An area that we flagged for potential improvement was incorporating more cardiovascular exercise into your routine. This, together with ongoing nutritional support, will help reduce your body fat percentage. 

We can follow-up any concerns at the practice. 

Hope you have a good end to the year.

Warm regards,
Dr Jessica Koen
