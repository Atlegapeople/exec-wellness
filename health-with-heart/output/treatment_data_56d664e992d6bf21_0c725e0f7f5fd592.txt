Comment Value: There were a few abnormal findings on your blood work that we can manage and monitor further. Making the lifestyle changes we discussed will help reduce these levels (raised total cholesterol/ raised baseline inflammatory marker). These are risk factors for developing future chronic illness and complications thereof. We started you on medication to help your insulin sensitivity and glucose control, as well as an Omega 3 supplement. Your Vitamin D levels were also low. We can supplement this and repeat levels on your next blood work in 6 months time. See your attached blood report.
