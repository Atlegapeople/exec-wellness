Overview Notes: Dear Jared, thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen. Fairly recent C19 has meant that you have not been able to exercise or eat very well. There are currently no major red flags but your lifestyle is reflected in a raised insulin, cholesterol and background inflammation. Lifestyle changes take a good 3-6 months to show change. So repeat the tests that were abnormal only after this time frame to review. It was a pleasure giving you feedback for your comprehensive medical!
