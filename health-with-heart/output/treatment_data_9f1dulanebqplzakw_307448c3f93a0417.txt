Overview Notes: Shirmila based on your medical today I have suggested that you check your iron levels as well as repeat your kidney function.

Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: Shirmila based on your medical today I have suggested that you check your iron levels as well as repeat your kidney function. Please also monitor your cholesterol and uric acid levels. You do see a dietician which is great and you are exercising. I would also encourage you to find ways to reduce your stress levels on a daily basis - whether it's through yoga, meditation/mindfulness, breathing exercises or whatever works for you. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you a healthy and happy year further.

Comment Value: 1. Full blood count suggests possible iron deficiency or thalassaemia trait. Do iron studies to exclude iron deficiency.
2. Suboptimal vitamin D levels - supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml.
3. Mildly reduced kidney function - may be within normal limits. Ensure adequate hydration and repeat test as well as check for protein in the urine.
4. High uric acid level - watch red meat and fructose intake and ensure adequate hydration to help flush uric acid out. If it remains elevated consider going onto puricos.
5. Slightly raised total & LDL cholesterol - ensure a healthy diet and frequent exercise and monitor levels annually.
6. High levels of inflammation - this is not a specific marker but avoid sugar, highly processed foods, toxins, stress etc. High quality Omega 3 & Curcumin are both excellent anti-inflammatory supplements.

Overview Notes: Shirmila based on your medical today I have suggested that you check your iron levels as well as repeat your kidney function. Please also monitor your cholesterol and uric acid levels. You do see a dietician which is great and you are exercising. I would also encourage you to find ways to reduce your stress levels on a daily basis - whether it's through yoga, meditation/mindfulness, breathing exercises or whatever works for you. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you a healthy and happy year further.

Overview Notes: Shirmila based on your medical today I have suggested that you check your iron levels as well as repeat your kidney function. Please also monitor your cholesterol and uric acid levels. You do see a dietician which is great and you are exercising. I would also encourage you to find ways to reduce your stress levels on a daily basis - whether it's through yoga, meditation/mindfulness, breathing exercises or whatever works for you. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you a healthy and happy year further.
