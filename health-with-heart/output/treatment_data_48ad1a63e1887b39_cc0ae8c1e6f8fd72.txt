Comment Value: - Slight neutropenia noted on Full Blood count - possibly due to viral infection.
- Vitamin D level is suboptimal. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 1000iu daily and repeat in 3-6 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.

Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months
