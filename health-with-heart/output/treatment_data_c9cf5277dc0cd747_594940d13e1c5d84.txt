MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: ASHLEY GOVENDER
Report Date: 2025-07-28
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Masha Tisetso
Clinical Recommendations: You examine clinically well with no concerns. We discussed your BMI being slightly above your usual baseline, but with summer and resuming running, it should improve back to your usual level.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, you have a good baseline and have been developing strong lifestyle habits. It’s understandable that winter can make consistency more difficult, but you’ve made great progress — and continuing to build on this will support your long-term health and prevent any future health complications.

We’ve started supplements to address the areas highlighted in your blood work, and we’ll plan to repeat your tests in 4–6 months to track improvements. If anything comes up before then, don’t hesitate to check in.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Clinical Recommendations: You examine clinically well with no concerns. We discussed your BMI being slightly above your usual baseline, but with summer and resuming running, it should improve back to your usual level.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
