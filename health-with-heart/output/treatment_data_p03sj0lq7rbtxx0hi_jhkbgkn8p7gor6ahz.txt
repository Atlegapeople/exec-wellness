MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Ashwin Lakhan
Report Date: 2021-12-07
Doctor: Christie Pilossof
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: Your blood results showed a normal PSA level. However these levels can be reduced with certain medications (Finasteride). Currently there is no concern as you report no symptoms related to your prostate. As you get older, both clinical prostate screening & PSA levels can be repeated.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.
Comment Key: ChronicMedicationList
Comment Value: Finasteride , Statin

Currently there is no concern as you report no symptoms related to your prostate. As you get older, both clinical prostate screening & PSA levels can be repeated.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Clinical Recommendations: You examined clinically well with a BMI and body fat % within normal ranges. You can find your hearing assessment report attached. All readings were within normal ranges with no concern.
Men's Health Recommendations: Your blood results showed a normal PSA level. However these levels can be reduced with certain medications (Finasteride). Currently there is no concern as you report no symptoms related to your prostate. As you get older, both clinical prostate screening & PSA levels can be repeated.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Men's Health Recommendations: Your blood results showed a normal PSA level. However these levels can be reduced with certain medications (Finasteride). Currently there is no concern as you report no symptoms related to your prostate. As you get older, both clinical prostate screening & PSA levels can be repeated.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Clinical Recommendations: You examined clinically well with a BMI and body fat % within normal ranges. You can find your hearing assessment report attached. All readings were within normal ranges with no concern.
Men's Health Recommendations: Your blood results showed a normal PSA level. However these levels can be reduced with certain medications (Finasteride). Currently there is no concern as you report no symptoms related to your prostate. As you get older, both clinical prostate screening & PSA levels can be repeated.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Raised liver enzymes can be a side effect of statins or can indicate a fatty infiltration of the liver which would need to be diagnosed on sonar. Try to watch your diet especially in terms of carbohydrates, start exercising, watch your stress levels and repeat the level next year. If still raised I suggest we do a liver sonar.
