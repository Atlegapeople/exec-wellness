Overview Notes: Dear Siyabonga, thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen. 
You are a family man, student and professional, all placing high demands on your time.  Unfortunately your lifestyle has suffered and this may present significant problems for the future.
Try to improve sleep by setting a time of day that you stop work and wind down before bed.  You can trial Magnesium or L-theanine (supplements) at night to facilitate sleep.  If you still struggle beyond these changes please follow up with a GP.
Lifestyle changes take a good 3-6 months to show change. I recommend repeating the tests that were abnormal after this time frame to review.
