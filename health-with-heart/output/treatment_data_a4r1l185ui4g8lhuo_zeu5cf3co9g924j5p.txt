Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Integrate some more life-work harmony. Not enough down time is a slow, but sure path towards burn out. You need more than 4 hours of sleep a night and at least an hour of no screen time ahead of going to bed. Blue light of screens inhibits melatonin which will interrupt your sleep wake cycle and contribute to your hormones not being in sync.

Overview Notes: Integrate some more life-work harmony. Not enough down time is a slow, but sure path towards burn out. You need more than 4 hours of sleep a night and at least an hour of no screen time ahead of going to bed. Blue light of screens inhibits melatonin which will interrupt your sleep wake cycle and contribute to your hormones not being in sync.

Overview Notes: Integrate some more life-work harmony. Not enough down time is a slow, but sure path towards burn out. You need more than 4 hours of sleep a night and at least an hour of no screen time ahead of going to bed. Blue light of screens inhibits melatonin which will interrupt your sleep wake cycle and contribute to your hormones not being in sync.

Comment Value: Thank you for doing your medical with us. You have recently made some fantastic wellbeing changes that are standing you in good stead. I think it's very important that you piggy back some more sleep, rest and restoration onto these already excellent changes. We discussed reducing red meat to once a week and once we have repeated your abnormal bloods, Ill touch base with you on a way forward. Wishing you a healthy and fulfilling rest of the year.

Overview Notes: Integrate some more life-work harmony. Not enough down time is a slow, but sure path towards burn out. You need more than 4 hours of sleep a night and at least an hour of no screen time ahead of going to bed. Blue light of screens inhibits melatonin which will interrupt your sleep wake cycle and contribute to your hormones not being in sync.

Overview Notes: Integrate some more life-work harmony. Not enough down time is a slow, but sure path towards burn out. You need more than 4 hours of sleep a night and at least an hour of no screen time ahead of going to bed. Blue light of screens inhibits melatonin which will interrupt your sleep wake cycle and contribute to your hormones not being in sync.
