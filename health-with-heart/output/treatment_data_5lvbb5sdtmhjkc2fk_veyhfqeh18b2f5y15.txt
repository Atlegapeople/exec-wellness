Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Marginally raised liver enzymes may be due to fatty infiltrate to the liver, non alcoholic fatty liver disease. Weight loss around the abdomen, reducing the carbohydrates in your diet, exercise and stress management can help to reverse this. Continue liver support supplements. Recheck levels in a few months, if still raised consider liver ultrasound.

Overview Notes: Marginally raised liver enzymes may be due to fatty infiltrate to the liver, non alcoholic fatty liver disease. Weight loss around the abdomen, reducing the carbohydrates in your diet, exercise and stress management can help to reverse this. Continue liver support supplements.

It was great to meet you and do your medical today.

Overview Notes: Marginally raised liver enzymes may be due to fatty infiltrate to the liver, non alcoholic fatty liver disease. Weight loss around the abdomen, reducing the carbohydrates in your diet, exercise and stress management can help to reverse this. Continue liver support supplements. Recheck levels in a few months, if still raised consider liver ultrasound.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Marginally raised liver enzymes may be due to fatty infiltrate to the liver, non alcoholic fatty liver disease. Weight loss around the abdomen, reducing the carbohydrates in your diet, exercise and stress management can help to reverse this. Continue liver support supplements. Recheck levels in a few months, if still raised consider liver ultrasound.
