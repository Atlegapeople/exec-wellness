Comment Key: VitalsRecommendation
Comment Value: Blood pressure improved on third reading to 122 systolic.  Keep monitoring with your GP. A waist to height ratio of more than 50% is associated with a significant  increased risk for chronic disease and cardiovascular disease events.  Focus on losing cm around the waist rather than the number on the scale.
