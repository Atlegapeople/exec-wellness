Employee: Nicolaas van Staden
Report Date: 2025-08-07
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You examine well clinically with normal blood pressure. With a family history of melanoma, a Mole Map screening can help detect concerns early. Your BMI is in the overweight range — improving nutrition, reducing alcohol, and staying active can help return it to normal.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes prostate health. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA result was normal. This can be repeated in the coming years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
