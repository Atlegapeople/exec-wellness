Overview Notes: Tsepho we identified a lot of issues today. It is very important for you to continue with and make further lifestyle changes. I would recommend seeing a dietician and following a low carbohydrate diet, losing weight, improving your sleep and increasing the amount of exercise that you are getting. Please follow up with us to monitor your progress. It's also important that you monitor your BP so we can start treatment if necessary.
