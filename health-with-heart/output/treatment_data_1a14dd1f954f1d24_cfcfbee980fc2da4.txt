Comment Value: A few of your inflammatory markers were raised at the time your bloods were taken. This is likely due to the UTI you had at the time (Confirmed on urine testing). I am glad that it has now clinically resolved. Your Vit D levels were also low. This we can supplement for 3x months and repeat your levels.
