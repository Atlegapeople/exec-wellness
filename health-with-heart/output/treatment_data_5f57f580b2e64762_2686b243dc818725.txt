Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Nkosingimele there were quite a few things noted on your blood results of which the most significant is that your HIV test came back as positive. This is most likely a cuase of many of the other issues noted such as your low white cell count. Your liver enzymes are also high and I would suggest an abdominal ultrasound. Your vitamin D is very low, I would suggest that you supplement with vitamin D.
