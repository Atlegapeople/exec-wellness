Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High ESR and hsCRP suggesting underlying inflammation. This may be due to insulin resistance, carrying extra weight, infection and other chronic inflammatory diseases. 
2. Low vitamin D level. Supplement with vitamin D3 5000iu daily. Retest level in 4 months aiming for 50 - 80 ng/ml.
3. High GGT liver enzyme - possibly due to fatty liver (often seen when overweight or with high insulin) or can be due to statin medication. If it persists consider doing a liver sonar.
4. Raised total /LDL cholesterol. Your GP recently started you on a statin but I would encourage some lifestyle changes too in terms of diet and exercise.
5. Your fasting glucose and insulin are both high suggestive of type two diabetes mellitus. Please discuss this with your GP. In the meantime I would advise starting glucophage, cutting out sugar and refined carbs and starting to exercise.
