Comment Value: - Your “bad” cholesterol is high. This can be lowered by limiting saturated and trans fats from your diet, adding healthy fats.
- Uric acid is high: reduce purine rich foods (red/organ meats, shellfish, legumes), avoid sugar, limit alcohol intake & drink more water.
- Vitamin D level is suboptimal. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. 
- Homocysteine high (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare.
Repeat tests in 3-6 months.
- Please do Hs-CRP as it was not done in these batch of tests.
