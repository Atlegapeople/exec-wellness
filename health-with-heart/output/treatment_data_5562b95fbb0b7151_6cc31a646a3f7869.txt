Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High ESR & lymphocytes on FBC, indicative of an infection. You mention that you did have flu/chest infection.
2. High hsCRP. This is a non-specific inflammatory marker that is used to help assess cardiac risk. However it can be high when you have an infection. Repeat when not sick.
3. Your Vit D level is low at  13 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu dly & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
4. Your cortisol (stress hormone) level is low. This may be related to your other hormonal issues wrt your previous pituitary adenoma. I have given you a copy of the results to discuss with your doctor at DGMC.
5. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is high at 16.8 umol/l.  You can reduce this by taking methylated B vitamins e.g. Metagenics MethylCare. Recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
