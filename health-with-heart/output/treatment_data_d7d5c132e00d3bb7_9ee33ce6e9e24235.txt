Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1.  FBC showed a low Red cell count with a high MCH and MCHC. This may indicate a Vitamin B12/Folate deficiency.
2. The eGFR (filtration rate of the kidneys) was slightly low. 
3. The AST (a liver enzyme) was elevated; it may be due to multiple factors including medication use or infection.  
4. The Total Cholesterol and LDL was high. Limiting animal product consumption and taking Omega3 and Niacin may help to reduce the levels. You may need to start medication.
5. TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone) was slightly elevated; it may be due to an underactive thyroid or other causes. 
6. DHEAS (a sex hormone) was high. There are multiple possible causes.
The abnormalities found in the biochemistry are not urgent but need to be addressed.  Please follow up with your GP in the next 8-12 weeks for repeat testing and further evaluation.
