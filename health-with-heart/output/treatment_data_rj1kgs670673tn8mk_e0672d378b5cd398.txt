Comment Key: MedicalHistoryNote
Comment Value: Current medical concerns include reflux, hypertension (well controlled), raised cholesterol and osteoarthritis of your knees. Since stopping Zuvamor yout cholesterol levels have gone up a bit however you have very low inflammation levels, which is a good thing. Please discuss with your GP but I'm happy for you to continue to manage your cholesterol through lifestyle, diet, exercise and supplementation with omega 3 and rychol and monitor your levels. Overall your blood results were good with the only abnormal levels being your cholesterol. . Stress management is also of utmost importance but is often difficult to do.
