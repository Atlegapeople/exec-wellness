Comment Value: - Homocysteine level is above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Lower "bad" cholesterol by limiting saturated and trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods and replacing all refined carbs with those high in fibre. Consider Rychol supplement to assist.
- Vitamin D level is low at 16.5 ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Make sure to keep hydrated
