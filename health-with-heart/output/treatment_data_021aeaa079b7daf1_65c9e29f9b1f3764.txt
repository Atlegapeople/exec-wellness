Comment Key: SpecialInvestigationRecommendation
Comment Value: Your BMI and body fat % were raised. Increased weight gain as we get older impacts our health and puts us at higher risk for chronic illness. Reducing sugar intake and focusing on nutritious foods (fresh vegetables/ fruit), along with regular exercise, can help achieve this goal.
