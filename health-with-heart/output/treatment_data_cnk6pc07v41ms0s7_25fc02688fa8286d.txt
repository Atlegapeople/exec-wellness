Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Vitamin D deficiency. Your levels were 13 ng/ml. Optimal Vit D levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Supplement with 50 000 IU Vit D3 weekly for at least 3 months. Levels can be repeated after this period.
2. HS CRP was high and may be due to underlying inflammation or infection. Insulin resistance can contribute.
3. High cholesterol and LDL. Levels may reduce by limiting refined carbohydrates/sugar, trans fats and animal product consumption, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. Please consider seeing a Dietician. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
4. Fasting insulin levels are very high. This means you are insulin resistant (a precursor for Diabetes).  This is still reversible with lifestyle modification! Intermittent fasting is a great way to reduce insulin levels and I'd like to encourage you to try it. Please see a Dietician and your GP to assist with management.
