Overview Notes: Homocysteine levels can be reduced by ensuring adequate intake of B vitamins. Sometimes it can be difficult to obtain adequate levels of certain B vitamins such as B12 on a vegetarian diet. Consider supplementing with a good quality vitamin B complex or a good multivitamin such as Phytomulti from metagenics. Aim to reduce homocysteine level to around 8.
