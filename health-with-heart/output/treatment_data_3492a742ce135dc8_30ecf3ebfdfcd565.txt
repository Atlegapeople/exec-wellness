MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Thanda Sithole
Report Date: 2025-08-05
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You examined well clinically, with no concerns. Both your BMI and blood pressure were within healthy ranges. Maintaining your current lifestyle habits will help keep these in a good range over time.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, you have a strong health baseline and are steadily building healthy rhythms into your daily routine. Small, consistent changes make the biggest difference over time, and you’re already moving in the right direction. Continuing to build on these habits will only strengthen your results and help prevent future health concerns.

We’ll review again in the new year to check your progress, repeat your blood work, and address any areas that may still need support. This will also include repeating an ECG (cardiac test) to ensure all findings remain consistent and stable.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your blood work reflects the healthy habits you’ve been building. Your vitamin D levels were slightly low, which we can optimise with a high-dose supplement over the next 3 months. There was also a slight increase in your homocysteine levels — increasing your intake of leafy greens and a variety of vegetables can help improve this. Overall, it's reassuring to see no significant concerns in this year's blood work.

Clinical Recommendations: You examined well clinically, with no concerns. Both your BMI and blood pressure were within healthy ranges. Maintaining your current lifestyle habits will help keep these in a good range over time.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, you have a strong health baseline and are steadily building healthy rhythms into your daily routine. Small, consistent changes make the biggest difference over time, and you’re already moving in the right direction. Continuing to build on these habits will only strengthen your results and help prevent future health concerns.

We’ll review again in the new year to check your progress, repeat your blood work, and address any areas that may still need support. This will also include repeating an ECG (cardiac test) to ensure all findings remain consistent and stable.

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen
