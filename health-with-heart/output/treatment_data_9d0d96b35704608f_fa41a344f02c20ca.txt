Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Please follow up with your GP to initiate ARVs.  Not treating HIV can result in many serious complications and extra infections.
2.Raised ESR on your full blood count.  Review this with your doctor when following up for the above.  My concern is it is linked to your HIV status (it may mean another infection like TB).
3. Your vitamin D is low at 8.  Supplement this for 3 months and review with your doctor.
4. Mild raised inflammation on Ultra- sensitive CRP. Start exercise, eat less sugar and manage your HIV to improve this.
5. Mild impaired stress response.  First address other points mentioned above and then review with a new blood test in 3-6months to monitor.
