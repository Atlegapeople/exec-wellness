Comment Value: 1. Vit D level is suboptimal 28 ng/ml. Supplement with vit D3 5000iu dly. Recheck your level in 3 months aiming for 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Your total cholesterol/LDL is raised. Follow a healthy diet: lots of veggies, low sugar/refined carbs and animal fat.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for 30 min is also important.  3.Low HDL ("good") cholesterol. It can be increased through exercise and omega 3
4. Homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 12.8 umol/l. It can be lowered by supplementing with methylated B vitamin (e.g. Metagenics Phytomulti) & recheck the level in 3 months. 5.High fasting insulin levels may indicate insulin resistance. The most important factors to address to reverse this are diet and exercise. Eliminate all sugars and refined carbs and exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week.

2. Your total cholesterol/LDL is raised. Follow a healthy diet: lots of veggies, low sugar/refined carbs and animal fat.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for 30 min is also important.  3.Low HDL ("good") cholesterol. It can be increased through exercise and omega 3
4. Homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 12.8 umol/l. It can be lowered by supplementing with methylated B vitamin (e.g. Metagenics Phytomulti) & recheck the level in 3 months. 5.High fasting insulin levels may indicate insulin resistance. The most important factors to address to reverse this are diet and exercise. Eliminate all sugars and refined carbs and exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week.

Overview Notes: Gareth it was a pleasure to do your medical today. We did pick up quite a few things which mainly relate to lifestyle factors, most significantly your raised insulin level but also high cholesterol levels. With three small kids I know that time is limited for self care and exercise but try to do what you can. Certainly you can improve on your diet which we discussed. I wish you a happy and healthy year further, with more sleep!
