Comment Value: 1. Slightly low white cell count and low neutrophils - possibly a side effect of tamoxifen.
2. High vitamin D levels noted - please decrease calciferol supplementation.
3. Marginally raised total and LDL cholesterol. Make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min is also important.
4. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 10 umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l. See glossary for more info.

Overview Notes: Carnita you have a significant medical history of breast cancer which is in remission. Overall you seem to be doing very well, your blood results were generally very good. Please reduce your vitamin D supplementation  and monitor your cholesterol. Your ECG had some irregularities for which I would suggest that you make an elective appointment to see a cardiologist for further evaluation. Your NervIQ exam suggests you are pushing into sympathetic (fight or flight) overdrive. Please prioritize rest, relaxation & mindful self-care.
