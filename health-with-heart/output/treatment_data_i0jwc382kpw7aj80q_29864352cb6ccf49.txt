MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Nigel Beck 
Report Date: 2023-07-07
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Normal examination on the day.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular Prostate screening (Examination & PSA levels) is recommended. I’m glad to hear that you’ve seen a Urologist & all results were normal. This can be repeated 1-3 yearly depending on your Urologist’s recommendations. Detecting any abnormalities early helps improve management.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few markers of raised inflammation in your body & future cardiovascular risk. This can be reduced through lifestyle adjustments such as reducing alcohol intake, regular exercise, diet (increase variety of vegetables) & stress management. 

Your cholesterol levels were also found to be raised. We have started you on a low dose statin & can repeat your blood levels in 3/12. 

These lifestyle changes should also improve your energy levels, sleep quality & general well being.

Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Mild gradual changes in vision reported. We recommend you see an Optometrist as you may need a new glasses prescription. They can also test your Intraocular Pressure to exclude Glaucoma. If any acute changes in vision- to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular Prostate screening (Examination & PSA levels) is recommended. I’m glad to hear that you’ve seen a Urologist & all results were normal. This can be repeated 1-3 yearly depending on your Urologist’s recommendations. Detecting any abnormalities early helps improve management.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few markers of raised inflammation in your body & future cardiovascular risk. This can be reduced through lifestyle adjustments such as reducing alcohol intake, regular exercise, diet (increase variety of vegetables) & stress management. 

Your cholesterol levels were also found to be raised. We have started you on a low dose statin & can repeat your blood levels in 3/12. 

These lifestyle changes should also improve your energy levels, sleep quality & general well being.

Comment Value: Your blood results showed a high cholesterol level. This can be managed with oral medication (statin) & lifestyle changes (diet and regular exercise). We can repeat levels in 3/12 to ensure adequate control. Raised levels increase your cardiovascular risk. 
Some of your liver enzymes were mildly raised. This is possibly due to impact from alcohol consumption. Reducing alcohol intake will hopefully positive impact these readings. We will monitor & review levels in 3/12.

Clinical Recommendations: Mild gradual changes in vision reported. We recommend you see an Optometrist as you may need a new glasses prescription. They can also test your Intraocular Pressure to exclude Glaucoma. If any acute changes in vision- to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular Prostate screening (Examination & PSA levels) is recommended. I’m glad to hear that you’ve seen a Urologist & all results were normal. This can be repeated 1-3 yearly depending on your Urologist’s recommendations. Detecting any abnormalities early helps improve management.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few markers of raised inflammation in your body & future cardiovascular risk. This can be reduced through lifestyle adjustments such as reducing alcohol intake, regular exercise, diet (increase variety of vegetables) & stress management. 

Your cholesterol levels were also found to be raised. We have started you on a low dose statin & can repeat your blood levels in 3/12. 

These lifestyle changes should also improve your energy levels, sleep quality & general well being.

Comment Value: Your blood results showed a high cholesterol level. This can be managed with oral medication (statin) & lifestyle changes (diet and regular exercise). We can repeat levels in 3/12 to ensure adequate control. Raised levels increase your cardiovascular risk. 
Some of your liver enzymes were mildly raised. This is possibly due to impact from alcohol consumption. Reducing alcohol intake will hopefully positive impact these readings. We will monitor & review levels in 3/12.

Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Mild gradual changes in vision reported. We recommend you see an Optometrist as you may need a new glasses prescription. They can also test your Intraocular Pressure to exclude Glaucoma. If any acute changes in vision- to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: You recently saw your urologist and your PSA is normal.  Your total testosterone is high which may not be significant after a normal urology check.  I would advise that we repeat this test again in 1-2 months to monitor a trend.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few markers of raised inflammation in your body & future cardiovascular risk. This can be reduced through lifestyle adjustments such as reducing alcohol intake, regular exercise, diet (increase variety of vegetables) & stress management. 

Your cholesterol levels were also found to be raised. We have started you on a low dose statin & can repeat your blood levels in 3/12. 

These lifestyle changes should also improve your energy levels, sleep quality & general well being.

Men's Health Recommendations: Regular Prostate screening (Examination & PSA levels) is recommended. I’m glad to hear that you’ve seen a Urologist & all results were normal.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few markers of raised inflammation in your body & future cardiovascular risk. This can be reduced through lifestyle adjustments such as reducing alcohol intake, regular exercise, diet (increase variety of vegetables) & stress management. 

Your cholesterol levels were also found to be raised. We have started you on a low dose statin & can repeat your blood levels in 3/12.

Men's Health Recommendations: You recently saw your urologist and your PSA is normal.  Your total testosterone is high which may not be significant after a normal urology check.  I would advise that we repeat this test again in 1-2 months to monitor a trend.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few markers of raised inflammation in your body & future cardiovascular risk. This can be reduced through lifestyle adjustments such as reducing alcohol intake, regular exercise, diet (increase variety of vegetables) & stress management. 

Your cholesterol levels were also found to be raised. We have started you on a low dose statin & can repeat your blood levels in 3/12. 

These lifestyle changes should also improve your energy levels, sleep quality & general well being.

Men's Health Recommendations: Regular Prostate screening (Examination & PSA levels) is recommended. I’m glad to hear that you’ve seen a Urologist & all results were normal. This can be repeated 1-3 yearly depending on your Urologist’s recommendations. Detecting any abnormalities early helps improve management.
