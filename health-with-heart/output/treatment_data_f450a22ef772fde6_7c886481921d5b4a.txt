Comment Value: 1. Your neutrophil count (type of white blood cell) is marginally low. This could be due to a viral infection but can also be normal for people of African ethnicity.
2.Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 10.9 umol/l. You can bring this down by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Aim for <7 umol/l. 
3.Your Vit D level is suboptimal/low at 24 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
4. Your cortisol and DHEA levels suggest that you may have been under a fair amount of stress for a long time. I suggest that you take 5mg of DHEA daily to support your adrenal glands to cope with stress.
