Comment Value: 1. Slightly low neutrophil count - can be due to a viral infection. Repeat FBC in 2 weeks to see if it has normalised.
2. Slightly reduced kidney function - would not be considered kidney disease unless it persists and there is protein in the urine. Repeat test, ensure good hydration and check urine protein/creatinine ratio.
3. Slightly high total/LDL cholesterol. Levels do not warrant medication. Eat a healthy diet, exercise for at least 30 mins 5 times a week and monitor annually.

Overview Notes: Zanele overall you seem to be in good health both physically and mentally. You have had a few scares of possible embolisms and an episode of chest pain recently for which you saw Dr Dube (cardiologist). Please follow up with him to complete the relevant investigations.
