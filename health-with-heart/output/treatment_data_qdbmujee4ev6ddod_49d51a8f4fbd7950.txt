Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Raised liver enzymes, likely due to an increased waist circumference and a fatty liver. Try to reduce cm rather than a number on the scale.
2. Mildly raised total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Get back to exercise and review in 6 months with a doctor.
3. Raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP.  Besides lifestyle your allergies may contribute to this. 
4. Raised homocysteine (cardiovascular risk marker). Make sure you are getting enough veggies rich in B-vitamins. Trial a supplement (Metagenics methylcare or homocysteine care) to help bring this down. 
5. Raised fasting insulin. While not diagnostic of diabetes this signifies a step in the wrong direction. Exercise will help correct this and chat to your endocrinologist about the possibility of Metformin for 3-6 months.
