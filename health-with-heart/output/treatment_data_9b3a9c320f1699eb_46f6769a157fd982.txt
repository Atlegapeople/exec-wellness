Comment Value: There were findings on your blood results that showed deficient levels in certain vitamins and minerals. From our discussions this is most likely a nutritional deficiency, that we can correct through improving your intake (dietician) and supplementation. Your bloods showed a signs of low Vitamin B12 and folate levels (macrocytosis and high homocysteine levels - 29). Repeat bloods done to confirm these levels. Your Vit D levels were deficient and require an oral supplement (script sent). Your glucose levels were also lower than expected. Adequate nutrition intake will improve this.
