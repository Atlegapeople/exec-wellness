Comment Value: 1. Slight decreased white blood cells which your specialist is aware of and monitoring for you.
2. Your kidney filtration rate is lower than currently expected.  I would like to repeat this for you when well hydrated in 2-3 months to monitor.
3. Mild increase in your total and LDL cholesterol after the festive season.  Get back to your exercise routine with healthy meals and monitor fasting in 3-6months.
4. Mild - moderately increased inflammation on your ultra-sensitive CRP. Your lupus will always contribute to this but living a healthy lifestyle and managing stress can decrease this as much as possible.
5. External steroids (Prednisone end of last year) will suppress your endogenous cortisol.  This will revert to normal in the next few months.
