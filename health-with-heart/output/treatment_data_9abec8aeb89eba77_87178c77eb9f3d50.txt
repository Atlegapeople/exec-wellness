Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1.Mild to moderately raised liver enzymes
This may indicate damage due to alcohol or medication (zuvamor).  Your liver enzymes may also be raised if you have an increased abdominal circumference.  Abdominal fat results in a “fatty liver” which decreases the effectiveness of your liver’s metabolic functions. The best way to treat this is to lose cm around your waistline. You can also take milk thistle or glutathione to support your liver. Please recheck in a few months and if still raised consider an abdominal u/s.
2. High triglycerides noted on lipogram - watch the carbohydrates in your diet. Total cholesterol well controlled.
3. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 11.1umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins e.g Metagenics MethylCare  or phytomultio & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
