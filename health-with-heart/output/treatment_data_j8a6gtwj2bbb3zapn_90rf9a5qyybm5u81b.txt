Comment Value: You are generally very healthy.
Sleep seems to be your only demon from a lifestyle point of view, we are going to try circadian and 5 HTP to see if this helps. Stopping the red bull might help your sleep too.( It is definitely your main vice from a dietary point of view).
Your are amazingly disciplined in your exercise regime and I can only suggest that you add some cardiovascular time at the end of your sessions. Your blood tests are beautiful the only concern is this indicator of inflammation which fits with the history of SLE. I have recommended a healthy diet full of vegetable and colourful fruit, 3 vegetarian meals a week, fish as well as omega 3 supplements (2g daily) to help with this.
The blood in your urine may be connected to the SLE but I have sent in your urine for extra examination of your kidney function and to look for other causes. Please follow up with your GP for these results. I have suggested this just to be completely thorough.
You had a slight upper respiratory tract infection and some mild diarrhoea on the day of the exam which I treated with a steroid nasal spray and vivomixx probiotics for each accordingly. If these problems linger please see your GP about it.
Caryn, it was lovely to meet you, you are a vibrant and happy person and you take good care of yourself. I hope that you enjoyed the medical and I look forward to seeing you next year.

Your blood tests are beautiful the only concern is this indicator of inflammation which fits with the history of SLE. I have recommended a healthy diet full of vegetable and colourful fruit, 3 vegetarian meals a week, fish as well as omega 3 supplements (2g daily) to help with this.
The blood in your urine may be connected to the SLE but I have sent in your urine for extra examination of your kidney function and to look for other causes. Please follow up with your GP for these results. I have suggested this just to be completely thorough.
You had a slight upper respiratory tract infection and some mild diarrhoea on the day of the exam which I treated with a steroid nasal spray and vivomixx probiotics for each accordingly. If these problems linger please see your GP about it.
Caryn, it was lovely to meet you, you are a vibrant and happy person and you take good care of yourself. I hope that you enjoyed the medical and I look forward to seeing you next year.
