Clinical Recommendations: Clinically you have no current concerns. Frequent self breast examinations are important - if you detect anything irregular we can follow-up for review. Mole mapping is also an import screening to be done. I am glad you’ve recently had one.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular Pap Smear and Mammogram screening are important for early detection of any abnormalities. It is great that your recent results have all been normal. You can also do a Bone Density Screen with the Radiologists at your next review.
Overview Notes: There were a few areas that we identified as putting you at higher risk for future health concerns. Sustainably making these changes/ reducing exposure can greatly benefit not only your current health but also your long term wellbeing.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your Total Cholesterol levels have greatly improved from your previous results. This may be due to the recent weight loss and diet change (reduced intake). Building a good exercise routine and nutritious diet can help maintain these levels. However we can repeat them in 6 months to monitor for any changes. Your hsCRP was raised - likely due to a subclinical infection at the time of the bloods. Your renal filtration rate was also slightly low - possible due to dehydration. Both these levels can be repeated in the new year.

Comment Value: We discussed your end of day routine (often with smoking and a glass of wine). Smoking puts you at higher risk for future cardiovascular events. Aiming to find alternative end of day rhythms can help alleviate stress. It’s hard to make these changes - but it can be very beneficial.
