Comment Value: Stephen it was really nice meeting you. We discussed quite a few things and I hope some of it can assist in you making 2022 a healthier year. I suggest reading Younger for Longer. Remember to make time for "resting and digesting" and work on improving your sleep hygiene and environment. Holidays and frequent breaks from work are needed. Hope the holiday coming up is a restful and joyful one with your family.
