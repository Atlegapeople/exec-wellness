Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Men's Health Recommendations: -After the age of 45 prostate screening is important. Some of the signs of prostate disease are poor erections, a weak urinary stream & having to wake up more often to urinate. Be on the look out for these as you grow older.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Losing weight, exercising, eliminating sugar, significantly reducing your alcohol consumption and managing your stress better will all contribute to helping you lose weight, lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of chronic disease. Please monitor your BP and if it remains elevated then make an appointment with one of our doctors to address it. Blood pressure is thought of as the "silent" killer and needs active monitoring.

Please monitor your BP and if it remains elevated then make an appointment with one of our doctors to address it. Blood pressure is thought of as the "silent" killer and needs active monitoring.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations:

I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Men's Health Recommendations: -After the age of 45 prostate screening is important. Some of the signs of prostate disease are poor erections, a weak urinary stream & having to wake up more often to urinate. Be on the look out for these as you grow older.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Losing weight, exercising, eliminating sugar, significantly reducing your alcohol consumption and managing your stress better will all contribute to helping you lose weight, lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of chronic disease. Please monitor your BP and if it remains elevated then make an appointment with one of our doctors to address it. Blood pressure is thought of as the "silent" killer and needs active monitoring.

Men's Health Recommendations: -After the age of 45 prostate screening is important. Some of the signs of prostate disease are poor erections, a weak urinary stream & having to wake up more often to urinate. Be on the look out for these as you grow older.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations:

I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations:

I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations:

I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations:

I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: -After the age of 45 prostate screening is important. Some of the signs of prostate disease are poor erections, a weak urinary stream & having to wake up more often to urinate. Be on the look out for these as you grow older.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: A very high hsCRP level puts you at high risk of heart disease. I would strongly encourage you to follow a mediterranean style diet, focusing on lots of colourful vegetables, moderate amounts of good quality protein and fatty fish and healthy fats such as olive oil, olives, avo, nuts and seeds. This anti inflammatory style diet will help to reduce your hsCRP. Omega 3 supplementations will also help.

Please monitor your BP and if it remains elevated then make an appointment with one of our doctors to address it. Blood pressure is thought of as the "silent" killer and needs active monitoring.
