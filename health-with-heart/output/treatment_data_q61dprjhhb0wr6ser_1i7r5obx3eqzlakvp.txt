Comment Value: You are already paying attention to your diet and lifestyle. Continue to follow a healthy diet and consider increasing your amount of high intensity exercise sessions to decrease waist circumference and lower cardiovascular associated risk. Of concern is the raised liver enzymes and reducing your alcohol intake should improve this. Your cholesterol is improved from starting Aspavor with your own GP, but may still be affected by less than optimal liver function. Your insulin and fasting glucose are excellent decreasing your risk of developing Diabetes Mellitus as in your family history.
We wish you a healthy 2020 further and look forward to seeing you next year!
