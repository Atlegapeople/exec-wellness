Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High total & LDL cholesterol which you mention is genetic. I would strongly encourage you to stop smoking, continue to exercise and follow a healthy diet. Supplementing with omega 3 and rychol may also help. Monitor annually.
2. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is normal but above optimal at 10 umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l. See glossary for more info

Overview Notes: Elisna you currently seem to be in good health, you are exercising frequently and eating healthily. I would encourage you to stick to one glass of wine a night and to please stop smoking. Overall your blood results were excellent apart from your raised cholesterol levels.

It was a pleasure to do your medical and I wish you a happy and healthy year further.
