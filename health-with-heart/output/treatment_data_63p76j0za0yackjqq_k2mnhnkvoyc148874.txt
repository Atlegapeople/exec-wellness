Comment Key: MedicalHistoryNote
Comment Value: Since you had COVID-19 in July 2021 you have felt tired, mentally foggy and generally run down. This could be from COVID but it can be exacerbated by stress, low vitamin D levels and slight insulin resistance. Taking the recommended supplements is definitely going to help you regain some of your vitality, as is your taking a break from work so you can spend time reprioritising yourself and finding a lifestyle that supports your health. 

The results of this medical do show that your body is trying to ask you to spend more time looking after it. If you can loose 9kg then your risk for diabetes and your risk for hypertension will decrease by 50%! So I would really plough energy into making sure you exercise, eat a more plant based diet with low refined carbs. I think that seeing a dietitian to support you in this is worth considering.

High blood pressure reading and slightly reduced kidney function with trace protein: 
1) Lower salt intake
2) Eat less meat by trying to limit to 2x a week
3) Make sure you drink enough water. 
4) Please come in to check you blood pressure in 2/52 to repeat the blood pressure reading. x3 high readings mean we need to consider next steps and possible medication.

Please do not forget your papsmear and mammogram which are both long overdue.

I hope this report will be helpful in guiding your health choices in the future. I wish you all the best.

Overview Notes: Your risks for cardiovascular events can be managed with diet and lifestyle interventions.
Comment Key: MedicalHistoryNote
Comment Value: Since you had COVID-19 in July 2021 you have felt tired, mentally foggy and generally run down. This could be from COVID but it can be exacerbated by stress, low vitamin D levels and slight insulin resistance. Taking the recommended supplements is definitely going to help you regain some of your vitality, as is your taking a break from work so you can spend time reprioritising yourself and finding a lifestyle that supports your health. 

The results of this medical do show that your body is trying to ask you to spend more time looking after it. If you can loose 9kg then your risk for diabetes and your risk for hypertension will decrease by 50%! So I would really plough energy into making sure you exercise, eat a more plant based diet with low refined carbs. I think that seeing a dietitian to support you in this is worth considering.

High blood pressure reading and slightly reduced kidney function with trace protein: 
1) Lower salt intake
2) Eat less meat by trying to limit to 2x a week
3) Make sure you drink enough water. 
4) Please come in to check you blood pressure in 2/52 to repeat the blood pressure reading. x3 high readings mean we need to consider next steps and possible medication.

Please do not forget your papsmear and mammogram which are both long overdue.

I hope this report will be helpful in guiding your health choices in the future. I wish you all the best.

Special Investigation Notes: Trace protein in urine, not too concerning but need to watch renal function and BP. High HOMA index suggests possible reduced insulin sensitivity.
