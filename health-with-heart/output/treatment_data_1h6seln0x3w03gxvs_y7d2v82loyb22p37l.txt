Comment Value: Thank you so much for doing your medical with us. You are in good health, you exercise and watch your diet, just tighten up on the sugars and refined carbs. I would also love to see you add some muscle building exercise to your routine, this will help with weight maintenance and bone strength (and is thus highly desirable). In addition to the above remember that you are due for a colonoscopy. Well done for being up to date with pap smears and mammograms. I recommend a DEXA bone scan to be done at your next mammogram.
Keep well and I wish you all the best in health.
