Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal at  26.3ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 1000iu daily & repeat in 6 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml.
- Liver enzymes raised: Need to keep and eye on this even though there is marked improvement with regards to your previous results done by your specialist. 
- Uric acid is high: reduce purine rich foods (red or organ meats, shellfish, legumes), avoid sugar, limit alcohol intake & drink more water. This increases your risk of cardiovascular diseases due to increased vascular inflammation.
- Homocysteine level is normal but above the optimal level. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare. Repeat level in 6 months.
- High fasting insulin indicates insulin resistance. Reduce refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet and incorporate regular exercise into your lifestyle (3-5 times a week for 30-60 minutes). Recommend a repeat in 6 weeks.
