Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. You are very anemic on your full blood count. Visit the gynae to address the root cause and visit the GP for a full iron workup. The GP can then commence with iron drips if indicated.
2. Low Vitamin D levels. Supplement for 3 months and review with your doctor.
3. Raised inflammation levels on ultra-sensitive CRP. Better lifestyle choices once your anemia is better will improve this.
4. Fasting insulin borderline on becoming high. Reduce sugary foods and start exercise once you have more energy. Building muscle and loosing cm is just as important as cardiovascular exercise.
