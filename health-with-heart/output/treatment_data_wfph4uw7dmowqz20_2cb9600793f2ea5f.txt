Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. A shift in white blood cells on your full blood count is possibly due to a low grade viral infection at the time.  This is usually not worrying.  Repeat the full blood count in a month to monitor.
2. A raised uric acid will predispose you to gout and increases your cardiovascular risk.  Decrease this by reducing daily alcohol intake and drinking enough water. This can be genetic too, so monitor with a doctor if you develop any joint pains!
3. Raised total and LDL cholesterol. Your reported lifestyle is not terrible and so your cholesterol may be due to genetics.  Try to improve your diet away from any refined carbs and saturated fatty foods.  Review in 3 - 6 months with a a doctor and discuss the pro's and cons of taking cholesterol medication.
4. A raised homocysteine can predispose you to cardiovascular disease and kidney stones. Lower this with veggies rich in B-vitamins.
