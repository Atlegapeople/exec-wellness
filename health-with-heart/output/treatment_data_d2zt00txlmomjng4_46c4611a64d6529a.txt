Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D is within normal limits but can be more optimal. Supplement for at least 3 months and review with your doctor.
2. A mildly decreased kidney filtration rate is often due to dehydration when you come fasting. The rest of your kidney function is normal. Repeat in 3 months to monitor.
3. Raised total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides. Reduce red meat and trial an Omega3 or Glucochol22 supplement. Review in 6 months.
4. Homocysteine within normal limits but can be more optimal. Methylated B-Vitamins (or dark green veggies) can help bring this down.
