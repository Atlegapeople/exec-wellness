Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly high haemoglobin - possibly a compensatory response to smoking and less blood loss due to very light cycles due to mirena.
2. Mildly decreased kidney function - recheck in 3 months and check for albumin in the urine.
3. High levels of inflammation - can be due to underlying infection, abdominal weight, smoking etc. Please stop smoking, eat an anti-inflammatory diet & consider omega 3 supplementation.
