Doctor: Christie Pilossof

Clinical Recommendations: Mild gradual changes in vision reported. We recommend you see an Optometrist as you may need a new glasses prescription. They can also test your Intraocular Pressure to exclude Glaucoma. If any acute changes in vision- to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: You recently saw your urologist and your PSA is normal.  Your total testosterone is high which may not be significant after a normal urology check.  I would advise that we repeat this test again in 1-2 months to monitor a trend.

Clinical Recommendations: Mild gradual changes in vision reported. We recommend you see an Optometrist as you may need a new glasses prescription. They can also test your Intraocular Pressure to exclude Glaucoma. If any acute changes in vision- to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: You recently saw your urologist and your PSA is normal.  Your total testosterone is high which may not be significant after a normal urology check.  I would advise that we repeat this test again in 1-2 months to monitor a trend.

Men's Health Recommendations: You recently saw your urologist and your PSA is normal.  Your total testosterone is high which may not be significant after a normal urology check.  I would advise that we repeat this test again in 1-2 months to monitor a trend.

Report Date: 2022-03-03
Doctor: Christie Pilossof
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Mild gradual changes in vision reported. We recommend you see an Optometrist as you may need a new glasses prescription. They can also test your Intraocular Pressure to exclude Glaucoma. If any acute changes in vision- to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular Prostate screening (Examination & PSA levels) is recommended. I’m glad to hear that you’ve seen a Urologist & all results were normal. This can be repeated 1-3 yearly depending on your Urologist’s recommendations. Detecting any abnormalities early helps improve management.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Cholesterol: Try to follow a mediterranean style diet with lots of colourful vegetables, fatty
fish 2/week and healthy fats such as olive oil, avo, seeds&nuts. Consider supplementing with Rychol and omega 3.

Clinical Recommendations: Mild gradual changes in vision reported. We recommend you see an Optometrist as you may need a new glasses prescription. They can also test your Intraocular Pressure to exclude Glaucoma. If any acute changes in vision- to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular Prostate screening (Examination & PSA levels) is recommended. I’m glad to hear that you’ve seen a Urologist & all results were normal.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Cholesterol: Try to follow a mediterranean style diet with lots of colourful vegetables, fatty
fish 2/week and healthy fats such as olive oil, avo, seeds&nuts. Consider supplementing with Rychol and omega 3.
