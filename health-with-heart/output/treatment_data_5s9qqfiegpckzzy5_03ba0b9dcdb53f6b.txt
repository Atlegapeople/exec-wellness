Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Low HDL ("good" cholesterol) - supplementing with omega 3 and exercise can help to increase it.
2. hsCRP is a marker of inflammation and can help predict risk for heart disease - your level falls into the average risk category. 
3. High fasting insulin level - this is most likely due to the fact that you have been eating more sugar than normal since being diagnosed with Grave's disease and losing weight easily. Please try to cut out sugar and refined carbohydrates.
4. Very low TSH indicating that your thyroid is still overactive. Please see an endocrinologist to help you manage this further.

Overview Notes: Lynette you were recently diagnosed with Grave's Disease and started on neomercazole. Your blood results show that your thyroid is still overactive. You do not have a specialist overseeing your care so I would recommend that you see an endocrinologist or go back to your GP who initiated the treatment. Your fasting insulin is also high - please watch the sugar and carbs in your diet and retest this in the new year. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
