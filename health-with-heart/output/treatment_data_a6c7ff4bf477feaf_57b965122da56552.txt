Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: As discussed in the consultation please visit your gynaecologist for follow up on the abnormal pap smear and a Radiologist for a mammogram
Overview Notes: Diolinda thank you for coming for your medical. Your obesity puts you at risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Your fasting sugar is borderline and I suggeste doing a Glucose Tolerance test and following up with your GP in terms of the result. You need to exercise more. I suggested the Sweat App as an example. Well done on making the change to a plant based diet - I think you will find a dietician referral helpful. Please follow the suggestions as indicated. I honestly hope 2022 is the beginning of taking care of yourself and hope that the sabbatical comes sooner rather than later. Something else I would suggest that you consider is seeing a lifestyle cough. Bhakti is wonderful and available for consultation at our Wellness Centre's and is a wonderful help and will assist in optimising your lifestyle.
