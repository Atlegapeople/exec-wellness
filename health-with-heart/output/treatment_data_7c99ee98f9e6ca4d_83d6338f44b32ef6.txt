Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Changes to your full blood count, uric acid and liver enzymes consistent with too much alcohol. Cut back to 1-2 drinks when you do have a drink. And also reduce red meat to improve the uric acid. 2. A mild decrease in kidney function consistent with dehydration on the day (due to being fasting for the other blood tests), this is not worrying and will correct itself when well hydrated.
