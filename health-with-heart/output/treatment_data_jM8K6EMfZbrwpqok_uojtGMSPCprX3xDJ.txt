Doctor: Skye Scott
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: You need to nominate our practice for me to refer you to a gastroenterologist to do a gastroscope and fix your hernia.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a gynaecologists for a Pap smear and a Radiologist for a mammogram. This is recommened screening for your age.
Overview Notes: Thank you for doing your medical with me. There are a number of issues to address. I think we need to start with diet and exercise and reducing meat and then recheck your bloods. You also need to take Vit D, I scripted Calciferol 50k twice a week. We must watch your kidney function and cardiac risk markers too. I will refer you to the specialist once I can. Please book a pap smear and mammogram too!

Comment Value: We discovered you have an abdominal hernia and are experiencing reflux at night. We discussed lifestyle change to reduce symptoms, but I recommend a screening scope anyway. You should also have a mammogram, pap smear and colonoscopy for screening at your age.
