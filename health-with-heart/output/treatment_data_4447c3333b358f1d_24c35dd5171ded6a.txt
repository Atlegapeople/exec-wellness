Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal at 21ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 1000iu daily and repeat in 3 months. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Homocysteine level is out of range. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solar’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Your “bad” cholesterol (LDL) is high. Lower by limiting saturated & trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, and replacing all refined carbs with those high in fibre. Supplement with Rychol to help lower cholesterol. Dietician also recommended.
- FBC showed a macrocytic picture which may happen with certain medications.
