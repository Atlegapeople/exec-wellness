Clinical Recommendations: Clinically you reported nothing of concern. Your BMI was slightly increased. This can be improved with nutritional adjustments (reducing sugar, increasing vegetable intake etc) as well as more regular exercise.

Your Vitamin D levels were found to be low. We can supplement these levels and repeat blood work in 3/12 to ensure adequate stores. Your homocysteine levels were also on the higher end of the normal range - this could be improved with increased vegetable intake (leafy greens). Otherwise there were no concerns.
