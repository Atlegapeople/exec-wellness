Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Clinically you have been adjusting after your surgeries to a new body and the way it functions. Taking it slow has been good. Reconnecting with your current body through Pilates has been helpful and hopefully continues to help rebuild your strength.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: You report that your recent mammogram was clear. Regular screening with the Radiologist will help detect any abnormalities early.

Comment Value: Your investigations showed good lung and cardiac function. Your body is still building up strength and the ability to exercise fully. As you build up your strength again, it will help weight loss (reduce body fat%) and lung capacity.
