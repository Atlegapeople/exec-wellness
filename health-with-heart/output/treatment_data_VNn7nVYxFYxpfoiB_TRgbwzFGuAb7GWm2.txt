Doctor: Skye Scott
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: I am concerned that you are sedentary and that your rash is so angry. Lets do a trial of limiting UV light exposure with topical cortisone and then review.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: I referred you for a mammogram. You have had a total hysterectomy and do not require a pap smear.
Overview Notes: Dear Zaheda, a few of your chronic disease follow ups have been neglected over the last year and so it feels like there is a lot of optimising we need to do. Issues to address include you new rash, blood pressure, high uric acid, cholesterol, inflammation and likely fatty liver which speaks to losing the weight around your middle and getting more physically active. Lets book a follow up so we can tackle each of these issues.
Comment Key: SpecialInvestigationRecommendation
Comment Value: It might feel a little overwhelming to do all of these screens right now so let's just do one at a time. Please book a follow up with me so we can complete them in order of priority.
