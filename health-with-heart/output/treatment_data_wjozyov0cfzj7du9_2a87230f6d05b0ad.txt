Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Mild increase in allergic reaction type cells on your full blood count.  This may be due to your asthma.
2. Low Vitamin D. Supplement for 3 months and review with your doctor.
3. Mild increase in your GGT liver enzyme. If still raised in 2-3 months on review further investigation may be needed. This is commonly due to gallstones in the gallbladder.
4. Raised uric acid.  Reduce red meat to 1-2x a week and increase your water intake. Visit a doctor if you experience any joint pains.
5. Very raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. This will be raised in the setting of chronic illnesses (esp your asthma).  A good lifestyle with lots of exercise, sleep and a healthy diet will help improve this.
