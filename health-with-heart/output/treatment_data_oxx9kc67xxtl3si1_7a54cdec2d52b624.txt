Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Homocysteine is above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimise by supplementing Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat in 6 months.
- HsCRP is at 1.4 mg/l. This is still normal, however, remember that the higher it is the higher the risk for cardiovascular disease. Having said that if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have increased the level up. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks.
- Your “bad” cholesterol is high. Lower by limiting saturated/trans fats from your diet, adding healthy fats (omega 3), eating more plant-based foods & replacing refined carbs with those high in fibre. Consider taking Glucochol22 and/or Rychol to aid in decreasing this.
- Your vitamin D level is low at 11ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml.
