MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: ZAEEM MOTARA
Report Date: 2025-07-17
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Masha Tisetso
Clinical Recommendations: Your BMI is within the normal range, however your body fat percentage is above the ideal. Maintaining muscle mass as you age supports a healthy metabolism & balanced hormone levels (i.e. testosterone). Incorporating a mix of cardio, stretching & resistance training will be beneficial.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, you’re becoming more mindful of your daily rhythms and how they influence your health. Your medical picked up a few early indicators that, with the right lifestyle changes, can be improved to help prevent chronic illness and future complications.

Change takes time, but small, consistent steps can create a big impact on your health and well-being. You’re already moving in the right direction, and building on these habits will only strengthen your results.

We’ll review again in the new year to check your progress, repeat your blood work, and address any areas you may still be struggling with. 

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: There are some early warning signs of potential future metabolic issues:
Insulin Resistance – A high fasting insulin level, despite normal glucose, indicates a higher risk for developing metabolic problems and possibly diabetes. With your family history, it’s important to make lifestyle changes now to reduce future impact.
High Cholesterol – Your levels are not high enough to require medication at this stage, but lifestyle changes are important. Regular exercise and improved nutrition (with possible support from a dietician) can help manage these levels.
Homocysteine – This may be elevated due to low vitamin B and folate intake. Increasing the variety and quantity of vegetables in your diet will help.
Low Vitamin D – We’ll start supplementation over the next few months and repeat levels next year.

Clinical Recommendations: Your BMI is within the normal range, however your body fat percentage is above the ideal. Maintaining muscle mass as you age supports a healthy metabolism & balanced hormone levels (i.e. testosterone). Incorporating a mix of cardio, stretching & resistance training will be beneficial.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening is an important part of medical reviews. For men, this includes the prostate. You're still young with no clinical concerns, and your PSA blood result was normal. This can be repeated in future years, along with examinations as you get older, to monitor for any changes.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, you’re becoming more mindful of your daily rhythms and how they influence your health. Your medical picked up a few early indicators that, with the right lifestyle changes, can be improved to help prevent chronic illness and future complications.

Change takes time, but small, consistent steps can create a big impact on your health and well-being. You’re already moving in the right direction, and building on these habits will only strengthen your results.

We’ll review again in the new year to check your progress, repeat your blood work, and address any areas you may still be struggling with. 

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen
