Overview Notes: Raised fasting insulin could indicate insulin resistance and may be a risk for diabetes. To lower your insulin please watch the carbohydrates in your diet. Continue your intermittent fasting, eat a lower carb higher good fat diet, continue exercising, manage your stress and try to lose some abdominal fat. Berberine can also help lower the level.
