Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High ESR (an inflammatory marker) may be due to infection or inflammatory conditions.
2. Low Vitamin D levels can improve by taking a Vitamin D3 supplement and eating vitamin D rich food eg. sardines and mushrooms.
3. High HS CRP (an inflammatory marker) may be due to underlying infection or inflammation. High insulin levels can contribute.
4. Slightly high Homocysteine. This is linked to heart disease and other conditions. Levels can reduce by managing stress, eating green leafy vegetables and supplementing with methylated B-vitamins.
5. High Cholesterol can be reduced by eating less refined carbs/sugar, trans fat and animal products, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
6. High fasting insulin suggests the Diabetes is not well controlled. Please see your GP as soon as possible.
