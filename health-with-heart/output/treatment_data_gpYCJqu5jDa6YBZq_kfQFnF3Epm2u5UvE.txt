Overview Notes: Nonhlanhla, it was wonderful to meet such a positive person! Please use 1-6 tablets of the Mag Citrate for regular bowels, sleep and anxiety assistance. The L-Theanine will also help. We need to fix your anaemia so please brave the needles :-) Do your bloods, the drip and come back for a mirena and PAP smear. Your Vit D also needs focus and supplementation. Wishing you a blessed and happy festive season with blessings in 2024!
