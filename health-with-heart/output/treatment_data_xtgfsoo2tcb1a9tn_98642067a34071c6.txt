Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Mildly reduced kidney filtration rate - not considered pathological unless it persists for more than 3 months with protein in your urine. Retest in a month and check urine microalbumin levels.
2. Mildly increased total cholesterol levels but good levels of HDL ("good" cholesterol). Monitor annually and continue to eat a healthy diet ( lots of veg, healthy fats, reduce animal fat) and exercise. Supplementing with omega 3 can also be beneficial.
3. TSH is a marker of thyroid function. Yours falls within normal but I would suggest full thyroid testing including antibodies based on your history of myasthenia gravis.
