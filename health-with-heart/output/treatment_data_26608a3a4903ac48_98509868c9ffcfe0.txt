Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal/low. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3/12. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Your uric acid level is high. This is a risk factor for heart disease and gout. Please ensure very good hydration to help flush out uric acid and keep alcohol, red meat and fructose intake low.
3. Your HDL level is low. HDL is considered "good" cholesterol and is protective against heart disease. Exercise and supplementing with omega 3 fatty acids can help to increase your HDL.
