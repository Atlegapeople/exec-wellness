Comment Value: Grainne you seem to be in good health, maintaining an excellent lifestyle. The only major concern today was your abnormal fasting glucose level which we will repeat and then go from there. As always it was a pleasure to do your medical and we look forward to seeing you again next year. We wish you a great year further but I will be in contact as soon as I get your repeat blood results.
