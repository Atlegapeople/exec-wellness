Comment Value: Thank you for coming for your medical. Weight loss and exercise is essential in tackling a number of the issues we "flagged" today. I think seeing a dietician and a biokineticist to help you in the right direction is a good idea. You want to exercise effectively and eat appropriately to help your body be the best version of you that you can be.
