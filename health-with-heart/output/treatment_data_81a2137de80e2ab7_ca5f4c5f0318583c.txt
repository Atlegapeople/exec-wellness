Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 32.3ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 2000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
2. Mildly reduced kidney function. Please ensure adequate hydration and monitor.
3. hsCRP (inflammatory marker) falls into the average risk category for heart disease. Exercise, an anti- inflammatory diet, stress reduction and omega 3 supplementation can help reduce inflammation.
4. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 12umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. e.g. Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
