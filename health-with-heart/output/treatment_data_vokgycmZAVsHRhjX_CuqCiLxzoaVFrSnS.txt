Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D level is on the low end of normal and could be more optimal.  Supplement for at least 3 months and review. 2. A very mild decrease in kidney filtration rate is often a result from being dehydrated due to being fasting on the day. Usually not worrying.  Review at your convenience in 3 months. 3. Your raised inflammation level on the ultra-sensitive CRP is more due to a recent bout of flu that time. Repeat when well again to measure your lifestyle's contribution to your inflammation.
