Comment Value: Marnette you have had a very stressful time over the last year or so with a home invasion, your health and menopause and then a pandemic to top it off. Conflicting advice regarding your Hashimoto's diagnosis also left you feeling confused. Now that things have calmed down work wise for you, I would encourage you to take some time for yourself and focus on self care and your health. As discussed I think it is important to follow up with Dr Magan regarding your thyroid and hormonal health. Ian Craig is also a wonderful nutritionist who can help you on the diet side of things. It was lovely to meet you today, I wish you well and look forward to seeing you again next year for your medical.
