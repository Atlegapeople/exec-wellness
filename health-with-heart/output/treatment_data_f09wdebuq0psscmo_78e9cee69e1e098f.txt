Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is low at  8.4ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. 
- Your homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins.
- Your “bad” cholesterol & triglycerides are high. Lower by limiting saturated and trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods & replacing all refined carbs with those high in fibre. Exercise also assists in lowering this. Consider taking Glucochol-22 & Rychol to assist with decreasing this.
- High fasting insulin: this may be an indication of insulin resistance or pre-diabetes. It is important to reduce your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake in your diet. Insumax supplements assist with Insulin resistance. Repeat in 2 months.
