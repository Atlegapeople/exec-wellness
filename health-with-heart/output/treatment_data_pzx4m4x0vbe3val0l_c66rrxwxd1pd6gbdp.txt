Comment Value: "Blaine - thank you for coming for your medical today.
You have had a rollercoaster 2 years and its been a lot.
We discussed quite a few things and I want to highlight a few below:
- Gout is a chronic inflammatory condition and what you are including in your diet can worsen it or improve it. Stay away from alcohol and red meat. Follow a more mediterranean/vegetarian diet. Seeing a dietician is a very important. Pippa is available at the Wellness Centre
- Your Blood Pressure and Gout is not optimised. Your ECG detects slight enlargement of your heart, your lung function is abnormal and you have a derranged Lipogram (cholesterol markers) I want to strongly urge you to see your physician ASAP so that he can review these results and optimise your treatment.
- You are now wheelchair bound with fixed flexion deformity at your knees, an open wound and significant small joint destruction in your hands. In order for you to stay functional at home and at work you need a Physiotherapist and an Occupational Therapist. This is very important. You want to maintain functionality of your hands in order for you to work on your laptop. Please see your Physio ASAP and consult an Occupational Therapist to assist you.
- A lot has changed over the last 2 years for you and your anxiety is worsening, your sleep is also affected. Seeing a Psychologist can help you and your family help cope with all the change that has occured. Please talk to ICAS as this is free to employees and they will assist you further. Getting into bed a bit later is something that you can try practice,. Sleepio.com is also a good resource, and limit screen time. Its also important to get fresh air during the day. Spend some time outside. Practice mindfulness and meditation. 
- Something that a physio suggested to me was admission to a stepdown facility where all of these allied staff is available. If your medical aid will fund this - you will be able to undergo therapy and rehabilitaion in one facility and you can be taught how to cope with your ever changing condition. This will also help your family as you will be more empowered to help yourself and they will be taught how to assist you in the best way possible. There is such a facility in Johannesburg - Netcare Rehabilitation Hospital. "
