Comment Value: Vit D3 suboptimal - replace with Vit D3 1000iu daily and repeat in 3/12
Your total cholesterol/LDL cholesterol is above the normal reference range.  If other cardiovascular risk markers are very raised we may decide to treat this more aggressively with medication. Make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products.  Regular exercise. 
Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg and Glucochol22. 
Homocystein raised - You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics Phytomulti & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
