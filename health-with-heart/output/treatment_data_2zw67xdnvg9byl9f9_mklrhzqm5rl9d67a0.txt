Comment Value: Nuno it was great to meet you and a pleasure to do your medical today. You are still young and relatively healthy but if you don't make some lifestyle changes then that could change. I have recommended the men's vitality vitamin packs for you - to cover a lot of bases. It contains omega 3's for inflammation and to support better cholesterol profile, nutrients for your thyroid, B vitamins to optimise your homocysteine level as well as nutrients to support testosterone levels. Specifically we chatted about decreasing alcohol, increasing your exercise as your hamstring gets stronger, reducing your stress levels through breathing and or meditation/mindfulness and improving your diet. Please let me know if you have any questions and we look forward to seeing you again.
