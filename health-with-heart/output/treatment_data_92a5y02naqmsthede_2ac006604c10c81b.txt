Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Clinical Recommendations: Toe - need to xray and then consider referral to ortho. Looks like a ganglion from trauma. Shoulder needs review. Need to reduce waist circumference - weight training!
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few areas that we identified to be optimised in order to improve your health & well-being. These areas of higher risk can be improved with lifestyle adjustments. Improved diet, exercise & weight loss will have a positive impact on your chronic illness profile & reduce your cardiovascular risk. Keep working towards building these good habits!

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few areas that we identified to be optimised in order to improve your health & well-being. These areas of higher risk can be improved with lifestyle adjustments. Improved diet, exercise & weight loss will have a positive impact on your chronic illness profile & reduce your cardiovascular risk. Keep working towards building these good habits! 

We can follow-up & monitor your progress.

You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

You report a functional manageable baseline.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Comment Value: You bloods showed the beginning signs of insulin resistance, low grade inflammation & raised cholesterol levels. These are all risk factors for developing chronic illness & cardiovascular damage. The lifestyle adjustments we’ve discussed & weight loss is recommend in order to reduce this risk. 
Your renal function was reported low - but this may likely have been due to the bloods been taken when you were fasting/ dehydrated. We can monitor & repeat these levels.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.

Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.
