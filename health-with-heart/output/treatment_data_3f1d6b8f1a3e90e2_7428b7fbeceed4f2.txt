Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a gynaecologists for a Pap smear and a Radiologist for a mammogram
Overview Notes: Marlini overall you seem to be in good health. Please pay some attention to stress reduction and improving your sleep as well as all the other recommendations above. I would like us to investigate your thyroid function further as your TSH suggests that you may have an underactive thyroid. Once you have done the bloods please make an appointment to discuss with us or your GP. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
