Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal at 21.3ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily and repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. 
- Your “bad” cholesterol is high. Lower by limiting saturated & trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods and replacing all refined carbs with those high in fibre. Supplement with Rychol/ GlucoChol-22 to assist with lowering cholesterol.
- Your hs-CRP is high which puts you at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have raised the level. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks.
- High cortisol - related to stress. Get quality sleep, exercise regularly, limit stress & stressful thinking patterns. Consider meditation.
- FBC showed a neutropenia usually seen with viral infections and certain drugs. Likely related to your surgery.
