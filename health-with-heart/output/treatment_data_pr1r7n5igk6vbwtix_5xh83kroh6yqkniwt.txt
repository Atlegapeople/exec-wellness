Comment Value: Mary, it was lovely to meet you, you are a happy well rounded person. You sleep well and have social connections and avoid cigarettes etc, which are all huge steps in the right direction. These are strong pillar in your health at the moment.
You just need to be more active, make it a focus as you move into winter, eating well and exercising will help you to stay younger for longer.
Keep up with your bone scans, mammograms and pap smears. You are also doing a great job of managing your hypertension.

I wish you all the best in your health!
