Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. FBC: slightly raised haematocrit (often due to dehydration) and slightly low lymphocytes (white blood cell) which is likely due to a recent infection. This is not concerning and the test does not need to be repeated.
2. Renal function was slightly impaired and is likely due to dehydration. Repeat testing in 2 months (when you're well hydrated) is recommended.
3. High Cholesterol can reduce by limiting animal product consumption and by taking an Omega3 and Niacin supplement. The fasting cholesterol can be repeated in 6 months after dietary adjustments have been made.
4. HS CRP (an inflammatory marker) was slightly raised and may be due to underlying inflammation or infection. High cholesterol and stress can contribute.
5. DHEAS (a hormone) was slightly raised and is likely due to the hormone replacement therapy you are taking. Due to the minimal deviation, there is no need to repeat the test.
