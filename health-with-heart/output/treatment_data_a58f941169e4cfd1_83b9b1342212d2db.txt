Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D is normal at 25 but can be more optimal at 50. Supplement for 3 months and review with a doctor.
2. Your triglycerides are high and your HDL is low (the "good cholesterol"). This is usually due to a diet high fat and refined carbohydrates. Avoid saturated fats and replace with Omega3 rich foods, and good fats (like Avo, olive oil and nuts).
3. Mild - moderately raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Increase your exercise and vegetable intake and reduce restaurant/Uber foods and sugar. 
4. Very high homocysteine levels (a cardiovascular risk marker). Vegetable rich in B-vitamins are very important to help bring this down.
5. A raised fasting insulin is a red flag for insulin resistance and developing diabetes mellitus. Exercise and eating habits are very important to improve this too. Repeat this screen in 3 - 6 months to monitor.
