Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Very low vitamin D level - supplement with vitamin D 5000iu daily for 6 months and then repeat level, aiming for a level of 50 to 80ng/ml. Once it is within this range then you can reduce the dosage to 1000 to 2000iu daily.
2. Your total cholesterol and LDL are marginally raised. I do not think your levels warrant medication but please pay attention to your diet and exercise and try to lose some abdominal fat.
