Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your red blood cells appear slightly small and pale. This has been detected on previous results and could either be due to iron deficiency due to vegetarian history or possible due to "mild" thalassaemia. Please do an iron profile and thalassaemia screening to confirm.
2. Your kidney function suggests that you were dehydrated when you tested which can be normal after fasting but please drink at least 2 to 3 liters of water a day.
3. Your total and LDL cholesterol are marginally raised but do not warrant meds at this point. Monitor and keep an eye on your diet.
4.Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 27ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Safe sun exposure can also help.
