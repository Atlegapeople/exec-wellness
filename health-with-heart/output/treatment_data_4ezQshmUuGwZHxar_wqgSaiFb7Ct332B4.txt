Comment Value: Your fasting insulin levels were high. This is a warning indicator for developing insulin resistance/ high sugar levels in the body. It is important to reduce these levels with regular exercise and improved diet (avoid high sugar intake). Your high homocysteine levels can also possibly be reduced with increasing your vegetable intake (especially leafy greens). This will help improve your Vit B and folate levels. The slightly lowered white cell count is not currently concerning. We can repeat this test in the next few months to ensure normal levels.
