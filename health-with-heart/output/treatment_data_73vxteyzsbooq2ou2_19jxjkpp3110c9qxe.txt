Comment Value: Isabella overall you seem to be in good health. Your activity level is excellent and your diet sounds good too. The only concern today was your suboptimal vitamin D level which can be corrected through adequate supplementation. Your main concern is your inability to lose weight despite your good habits. I recommend checking your hormone levels in relation to this. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and we wish you a happy and healthy year further.
