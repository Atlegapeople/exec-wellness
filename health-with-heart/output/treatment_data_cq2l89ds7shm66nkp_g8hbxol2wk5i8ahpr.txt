Comment Value: Stephen it was really nice meeting you. We discussed quite a few things and I hope some of it can assist in you making 2022 a healthier year. I suggest reading Younger for Longer. Remember to make time for "resting and digesting" and work on improving your sleep hygiene and environment. Holidays and frequent breaks from work are needed.
