Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly raised eosinophils noted on FBC. This can be due to allergies or parasites. I would encourage you to 'deworm' yourself.
2. Your Vit D level is low at 19ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
3. Your cholesterol and triglycerides are a bit high. Make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min is also important. Omega 3 and Rhychol may help.
4. Your hsCRP level indicates average levels of inflammation -Avoid sugar, highly processed foods, toxins, stress etc. High quality Omega 3 and Curcumin are excellent anti-inflammatory supplements.
5. Your fasting insulin levels are within normal at 8.4mIU/l but still above optimal. Continue with glucophage and lifestyle changes.
