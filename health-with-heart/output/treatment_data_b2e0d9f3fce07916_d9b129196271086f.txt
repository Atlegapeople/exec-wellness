Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High creatinine levels and reduced kidney function. Please be careful of over supplementing with creatine and repeat kidney function when well hydrated and not after a hard gym session to reassess. It is even more important that your blood pressure is optimal if there is some kidney dysfunction.
2. Fasting insulin level within normal but above optimal. Watch the carbs/starch in your diet and when you do eat carbs try to combine with fibre, protein and fat to reduce the blood sugar response.
