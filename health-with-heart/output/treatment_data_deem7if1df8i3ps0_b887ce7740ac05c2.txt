Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D can be more optimal. Supplement for 3 months and review.
2. Raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP.  Poor sleep, too much alcohol and stress will increase this. Monitor after 3-6 months after you have addressed these.
3. Your free testosterone and morning cortisol is borderline low. Loosing cm around your waist may help improve this. If persistently low after review it is possible to see a specialist to discuss testosterone replacement which will help with fatigue and burnout.
