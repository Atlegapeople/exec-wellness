Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at 20ng/ml. Supplement with Vitamin D3 5000iu daily & recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- “bad” cholesterol is high. Follow dietary advice. Supplementation with Rychol or Glucochol22 may assist to lower this. Repeat in 6 months.
- homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- HsCRP (chronic inflammatory marker) is at 1.4 mg/l -lower through exercise, weight loss, and dietary control. Repeat in 6 weeks.
