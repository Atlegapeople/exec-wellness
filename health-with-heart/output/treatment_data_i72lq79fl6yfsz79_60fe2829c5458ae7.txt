Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Your vitamin D level is suboptimal at  29ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 1000iu daily and repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance
- Your homocysteine level (Marker used to assess risk of autoimmune, heart and chronic diseases) is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Your “bad” cholesterol is high. Lower by limiting saturated and trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods and replacing all refined carbs with those high in fibre. Supplementation with Omega 3 fatty acids and Rychol may assist to decrease this.
