Comment Value: Titus it was a pleasure meeting you. 
You have very low testosterone levels on your blood results - We are repeating the levels and then considering referring you to an Endocrinologist.
You work very hard. We need to make time to activate your "rest and digest" cycle a bit more. Meditation, spending more time with your loved ones, walking on grass barefoot for 10minutes and turning the shower to cold for 30seconds can activate your Parasympathetic System.
Working out more frequently for at least 30mins 4 times a week will also assist in bringing your blood pressure down. 
Good luck with all the travelling. Hope 2022 is a healthy, more energetic year for you.

Comment Value: Titus it was a pleasure meeting you. 
You have very low testosterone levels on your blood results - We are repeating the levels and then considering referring you to an Endocrinologist.
You work very hard. We need to make time to activate your "rest and digest" cycle a bit more. Meditation, spending more time with your loved ones, walking on grass barefoot for 10minutes and turning the shower to cold for 30seconds can activate your Parasympathetic System.
Working out more frequently for at least 30mins 4 times a week will also assist in bringing your blood pressure down. 
Good luck with all the travelling. Hope 2022 is a healthy, more energetic year for you.
