Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - Your “good” cholesterol - HDL - is low. Trade saturated fat found in meats for healthier fat found in plants, such as olive and canola oils. Instead of red meat, try fish high in omega-3 fatty acids — such as mackerel or salmon. Avoid trans fats or foods with hydrogenated oils or fats.
- Triglycerides are high - lower by exercising regularly, avoiding sugar & refined carbs. Alcohol is high in calories and sugar and has a particularly potent effect on triglycerides. Limit consumption. Extra calories are converted to triglycerides and stored as fat. Reducing your calories will reduce triglycerides. Repeat in 3 months
Liver enzyme GGT was slightly raised. This could be caused by certain medications, alcohol or damage the vile ducts. Please follow up with GP for review.
Continue follow up with specialist for thyroid function.
