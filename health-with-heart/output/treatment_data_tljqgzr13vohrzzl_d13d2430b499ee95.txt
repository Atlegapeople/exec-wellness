Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. The full blood count (FBC) suggests you may have a Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. You report that you've donated blood a week prior to doing the blood test which may affect the result. Repeat test in 2 months is advised. The FBC also suggests you've recently been exposed to a viral infection. This is not concerning and does not need further investigation. 
2. Very high cholesterol and LDL. Levels may reduce by limiting refined carbohydrates/sugar, trans fats and animal product consumption, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. Please consider seeing a Dietician. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
