Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: You are scheduled to see your gynae to do a repeat pap smear.
Overview Notes: Carmona overall you are in excellent health and super fit! You mention that you are suffering from severe night sweats and have seen the gynae and an endocrinologist without really getting an answer. I suspect the answer may lie in your extreme training and very low body fat. Please make sure that you are adequately fuelling your body and prioritise rest and recovery! I wish you the best of luck for Ironman and a happy and healthy remainder of 2022.

Women's Health Recommendations: You are scheduled to see your gynae to do a repeat pap smear.
Overview Notes: Carmona overall you are in excellent health and super fit! You mention that you are suffering from severe night sweats and have seen the gynae and an endocrinologist without really getting an answer. I suspect the answer may lie in your extreme training and very low body fat. Please make sure that you are adequately fuelling your body and prioritise rest and recovery! I wish you the best of luck for Ironman and a happy and healthy remainder of 2022.
