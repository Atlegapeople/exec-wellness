Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: Raised hsCRP: suggests increased levels of inflammation in the body which puts you at higher risk for heart disease. You did have covid a few months ago which may have contributed. Things to consider to lower inflammation include a healthy mediterranean style diet, exercise, stress reduction, omega 3's and curcumin.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: Raised hsCRP: suggests increased levels of inflammation in the body which puts you at higher risk for heart disease. You did have covid a few months ago which may have contributed. Things to consider to lower inflammation include a healthy mediterranean style diet, exercise, stress reduction, omega 3's and curcumin.

Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: Raised hsCRP: suggests increased levels of inflammation in the body which puts you at higher risk for heart disease. You did have covid a few months ago which may have contributed. Things to consider to lower inflammation include a healthy mediterranean style diet, exercise, stress reduction, omega 3's and curcumin.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: Raised hsCRP: suggests increased levels of inflammation in the body which puts you at higher risk for heart disease. You did have covid a few months ago which may have contributed. Things to consider to lower inflammation include a healthy mediterranean style diet, exercise, stress reduction, omega 3's and curcumin.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram. Consider seeing a gynae for an ultrasound. Recently went through menopause but you are relatively asymptomatic.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI is normal but your waist circumference is slightly high at 85cm. Try to reduce it to 80 cm or below.
