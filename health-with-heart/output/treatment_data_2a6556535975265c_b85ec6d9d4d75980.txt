Comment Value: 1. Your vitamin D level falls just into the sufficient range however optimal would be a bit higher. Continue with your calciferol and recheck level in 4 months.
2. Mildly elevated cholesterol. Optimise diet and exercise and monitor annually.
3. Your homocysteine is high. Supplementing with "activated" B vitamins can lower this e.g. Methylcare or NeuroXcel. Recheck in 4 months aiming for 7umol/l.
