Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Overall excellent blood results. Your TSH looks indicates that your thyroid levels are most likely fine on Euthyrox - I would however recommend that you check for thyroid antibodies as it seems this was never done.
High hsCRP level (7.4mg/L) indicating high levels of inflammation, surprising given your excellent health and that you are taking curcumin. Could possibly be explained by an underlying infection or injury. I would recommend repeating it.

Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Sally overall you seem to be in excellent health. Please make sure that you nourish your body enough and get some recovery time! Overall your blood results looked great but I recommend checking thyroid antibodies and repeating the hsCRP (inflammatory marker) that was high. Your ECG shows a very slow heart rate and right atrial enlargement - which may be normal for you but to be prudent I would recommend seeing a cardiologist for an echo. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and all the best for world champs!
