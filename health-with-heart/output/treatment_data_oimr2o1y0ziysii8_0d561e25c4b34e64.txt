Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Jacques you are generally very fit and healthy. I would however encourage you to ensure that you are eating an optimal vegan diet if you choose to stick with it and if so you will also need to supplement with B12. We identified a macrocytic anaemia which given your history is most likely as a result of your vegan diet. Please check your B12 and iron levels and then we can advise you further. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and we look forward to seeing you again.
