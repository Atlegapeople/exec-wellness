Comment Value: Your Vit D levels were below the normal range. To supplement Vit D for 3/12 & then we can review your blood levels. You currently show no signs of anaemia - despite previous low iron levels. Your iron supplements will help maintain levels & we can test your iron profile in 3/12. There were indicators of inflammation on your blood results. This is often due to lifestyle issues (weight, sugar, diet etc.) & lead to varied risk for cardiovascular events. Chronic stress can also impact this. Improvements, as mentioned, in lifestyle should help lower this risk. There are supportive Weight loss programs. These can be helpful in aiming for sustainable weight loss.
