Report Date: 2022-07-06
Doctor: Carla Marais
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: BP raised in the examination at 152/92
Abnormal Audiology screen: Normal to mild sloping high frequency hearing loss bilaterally. A full test is recommended with possible management.
Men's Health Recommendations: We have referred Cor for a prostate sonar and depending on the result - will be referred appropriately
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Cor, thank you for coming for your medical. Your Cardiovascular risk score is raised due to the uncontrolled blood pressure, your age and cholesterol readings. Your ECG picked up an irregularity. This can be of no significance, however due to the uncontrolled BP & high cardiovascular risk score a Cardiology review is not a bad idea. We have opted to start with a 24hour BP monitor. We have opted to supplement with Vit D, Omega 3 and Glucachol. Follow a mediteranean style diet, continue exercising and repeat Cholesterol levels in 6 months time. Your screening is also due and a Gastroenterologist has been recommended. Prostate sonar also suggested. Please follow up with your chosen GP with the results.
Hope the rest of 2022 is a healthy year for you.
