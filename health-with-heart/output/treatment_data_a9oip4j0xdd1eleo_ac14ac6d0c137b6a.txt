Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High ESR noted on your full blood count - suggesting underlying inflammation or infection. You recently had flu which may be the cause.
2. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 20ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
3. Your uric acid level is elevated. This is a risk factor for heart disease and gout. Please ensure very good hydration to help flush out uric acid and keep alcohol, red meat and fructose intake as low as possible.
4. hsCRP level is high indicating high levels of inflammation. Again this may have been due to an underlying infection but also try to avoid sugar, highly processed foods, toxins and stress. High quality Omega 3 and Curcumin are excellent anti-inflammatory supplements. Repeat the level in the new year.

Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a Radiologist for a mammogram
Overview Notes: La-Nes you have had an extremely stressful year generally and the last few week have been very hard for you between work, moving house and caring for your daughter. This has affected your physical and emotional well being. I am glad that you are going on leave this week. Please take the time to look after yourself, rest and relax. Try to be more mindful of your diet and if possible start some gentle exercise. I wish you a wonderful, restorative festive season and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
