Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Vit D level is suboptimal. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3/12. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 2. Your testosterone level is on the lower side of normal. I suspect the performance enhancing substances that you are using at gym may be influencing this. 3. Your kidney function shows high creatinine - again this may be due to the substances you are using. Please stop taking them, ensure very good hydration. Repeat in 1/12
4. Raised liver enzymes. This may indicate damage due to alcohol/medication. In your case possibly the gym products. Please stop, repeat levels in a month.
5. Your homocysteine is high. We need to bring this down by supplementing with methylated B vits. Please take Metagenics MethylCare& repeat in 3/12. 
6. Your HsCRP was above optimal. This puts you in the high risk category for cardiovascular disease. Please keep an eye on BP&cholesterol.

Overview Notes: Geronomow it was a pleasure to do your medical today. We picked up quite a lot of abnormal values on your blood results. I strongly encourage you to stop all the gym products and then repeat your bloods. Otherwise you are fit and eating a very healthy diet. I look forward to seeing you again next year.
