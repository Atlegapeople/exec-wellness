Employee: Manoj Maharaj
Report Date: 2023-08-25
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Your blood pressure was raised. This puts you at risk for future cardiovascular events/ strokes - thus we need to optimise your pressure control. We can help find improved methods of consistently taking your pills daily. Stress also plays a role and finding time to rest is important.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to see your PSA levels were normal on your blood work. Regular prostate screening is important for early detection of any abnormalities as you get older & improves management outcomes. You can monitor for any symptoms & consult for further review.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: There were a few areas that we identified as putting you at high risk for poor health outcomes. You have been through a hard season of grief and struggled with harmful lifestyle habits. Taking the time to rest and look after yourself is important - so you can be there to support those around you. 

We are here to support you in whatever way we can. To help monitor and optimise your chronic conditions. We want to prevent any future complications and help you find your feet again.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your markers for diabetes were raised (both high sugar and insulin levels). We need to monitor this and possibly start you on medication. Your Urate levels were also raised, possibly due to the amount of alcohol you consume. This puts your body at risk of damage. Cutting down on your alcohol will help lower these levels again and prevent negative impact. Your low Vit D levels can be supplemented and blood levels repeated in 3/12.
