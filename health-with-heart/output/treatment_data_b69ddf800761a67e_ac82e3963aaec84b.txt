Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is low at 21ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. 
2. Your one liver enzyme is mildly elevated - causes can include alcohol or medication such as a statin. Supplementing with coQ10 can reduce side effects of statins and taking milk thistle can support the liver.
3. Your total cholesterol is slightly high however your LDL is within normal. Triglycerides were high - this can be due to alcohol or starch/sugar in the diet. Keep monitoring this.
