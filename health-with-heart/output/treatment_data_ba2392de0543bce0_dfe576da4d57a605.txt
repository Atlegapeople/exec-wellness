Comment Value: 1. eGFR (filtration of the kidneys) was low at 66 ml/min. The normal range is > 90ml/min.
2. Uric acid elevated at 0.41 mmol/L. This is a risk for heart disease and it may lead to the development of gout.
3. Fasting glucose was high at 6.4 mmol/L. Your Diabetes is likely uncontrolled.
4.  Cortisol was low at 173 nmol/L; this indicates your stress response is decreased and may be due to recent cortisone treatment. Repeat test in 6-8 weeks is advised.
Please consult your Doctor to assist with further evaluation of the abnormal test results.
