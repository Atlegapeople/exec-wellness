Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your cholesterol/ LDL was borderline high. This needs to be monitored as it is a risk factor for future cardiovascular disease. Adjusting your lifestyle (diet/ increased vegetables/ reduced processed fatty foods) may help control your levels - otherwise a low dose Statin may need to be initiated. Your cortisol levels were low for the time of day your bloods were taken. This may be explained due to inhaled corticosteroid use (asthma pumps). Low Vit D levels can be supplemented & levels retest in 3/12.
