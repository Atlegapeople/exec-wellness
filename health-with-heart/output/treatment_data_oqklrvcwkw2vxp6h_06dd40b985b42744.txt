Comment Value: 1. Low lymphocytes (white blood cells) - probably a side effect of methotrexate and prednisone.
2. Vitamin D levels are within normal but on the low side - supplement with vitamin D3 2000iu daily.
3. Slightly reduced kidney function - but has not decreased since 2019. Monitor annually and ensure good BP and sugar control.

5. High uric acid levels - can cause heart disease and gout. Reduce alcohol and drink 2 to 3 litres of water a day to help flush out.
6. Slightly high cholesterol and high triglycerides - decrease sugar, alcohol and processed foods, increase veg.
7. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is high at 18umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
