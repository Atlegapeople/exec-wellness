Comment Value: Thanks for doing the medical with us today. It was a pleasure to meet you.
Overall you take good care of yourself you eat well, exercise and socialise, you enjoy work and find it satisfying. These are all very important aspects of preventative health.

I am worried about your lung function tests and I do think they indicate that your lungs are suffering from the asthma, compounded by smoking. I would strongly recommend that you stop smoking, I know that you aren't ready but, these results might highlight the reality of the consequences of smoking to you. Please consider a Pulmonology consultation. So I hope they motivate you to think about it. Suffering with emphysema is a real possibility for you and its still avoidable.

Please come in for your blood tests as mentioned above. You are also due for a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer.
Your prostate exam and blood test are normal so you can repeat this in 1-2 years.

Good luck and I wish you all the best in health going forward.
