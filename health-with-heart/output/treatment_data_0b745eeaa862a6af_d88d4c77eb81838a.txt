Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is low at 10ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
2. Your liver enzymes may be raised if you have an increased abdominal circumference.  Abdominal fat results in a “fatty liver” which decreases the effectiveness of your liver function. You can take milk thistle to support your liver. 
3. Your total cholesterol/LDL cholesterol is a bit high.  Before we consider medication, make sure you follow a healthy diet and exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3 & Rhychol.
4. Your homocysteine is above optimal at 12.5 umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Solal homocysteine lowering formula & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
