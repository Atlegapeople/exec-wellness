Comment Value: 1. Low Vitamin D levels. Supplement for at least 3 months and review. 2. Two liver enzymes are out of range, the cause for this is not clear but could be due to an increased waist line (fatty liver). Please review your liver function tests again in 2-4weeks to monitor. If the result is increased then a liver ultrasound may be needed.  3. Raised cholesterol and triglycerides.  We have started medication for this. Review in 3-6 months.

Comment Value: 1. Low Vitamin D levels. Supplement for at least 3 months and review. 2. Two liver enzymes are out of range, the cause for this is not clear but could be due to an increased waist line (fatty liver). Please review your liver function tests again in 2-4weeks to monitor. If the result is increased then a liver ultrasound may be needed.  3. Raised cholesterol and triglycerides.  We have started medication for this. Review in 3-6 months.
