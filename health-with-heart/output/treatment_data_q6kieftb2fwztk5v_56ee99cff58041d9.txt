MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Danillo Chetty
Report Date: 2022-10-20
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Your investigations show a high BMI. Increased adipose tissue can cause metabolic disturbances (see blood results), joint strain as well as increased risk for future chronic illness. Working together with support structures (dietician/ exercise) can help reduce your current weight.
Men's Health Recommendations: Screening of your prostate gland starts over the age of 40 years old. This can be done through a blood test (PSA levels) and clinically examination as you get older. Currently you report no symptoms of concern.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall there were a few areas that we identified as putting you at higher risk for chronic illness in the future. Your investigations showed multiple warning signs that need to be monitored. 

We discussed the lifestyle habits that can help reduce this risk. Making these changes is challenging but will be worth it in the long run. Your head is in a good space - keep going! 

We can follow-up in the next few months for repeat blood work (Vit D/ ALT/ Fasting glucose/ insulin/ hsCRP/ Cholesterol).

Kind regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your blood results showed a few abnormalities that need to addressed. Many of these factors can be improved with lifestyle changes. Your total cholesterol, Uric acid and insulin levels (showing insulin resistance and pre-diabetes) showed abnormal results. Improving your nutrition (increasing vegetable intake, reducing sugar, portion control), regular exercise and resultant weight loss, will all have positive impacts on these results. We discussed seeing a dietician to help with meal planning. Your Vit D levels were also low. We can supplement and repeat your blood levels in 3/12. An inflammatory marker known hsCRP was markedly raised. This may be due to a sub clinical viral infection - however we will need to monitor this on your next blood work.
