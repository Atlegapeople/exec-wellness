Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular Pap smear screening helps detect any abnormalities early & improves management outcomes. Your recent Pap Smears have been normal. You can book your next follow-up with your GP or Gynae. Mammogram screening also becomes important as you get older (>40 years).
Overview Notes: Overall you have a healthy baseline. Keep going! A few areas that we identified to be optimised include developing an exercise routine as well as improving diet (avoiding high sugar intake). Making these adjustments will have a positive impact on your general well-being & future health.

I hope everything goes well with your Neurologist. We can follow-up any concerns or chronic conditions you need help managing.
