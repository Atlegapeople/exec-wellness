Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly low neutrophil count (type of white blood cell) - maybe normal in African populations or can be due to autoimmune conditions like SLE.
2.Your Vit D level is low at 17.9ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
3. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is high at 15umol/l.  This can be a side effect of methotrexate. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Stellar Activ-Folate/Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l. 
4. Total and LDL cholestrol slightly raised - follow a healthy diet: lots of veggies, low in sugar, refined carbs and animal products.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min is also important. 
5. Mildly reduced kidney function, Please monitor.
