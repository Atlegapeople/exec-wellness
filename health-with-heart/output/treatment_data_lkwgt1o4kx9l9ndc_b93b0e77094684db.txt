2. Marginally low AST liver enzyme - may be an indication of vitamin B6 deficiency so please take a multivitamin or B complex that includes B6.
3. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 31ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. See glossary for more info.
4. Your TSH level suggests that you thyroid hormone levels may be suboptimal. I suggest that you check your thyroid hormone levels and thyroid antibodies.
