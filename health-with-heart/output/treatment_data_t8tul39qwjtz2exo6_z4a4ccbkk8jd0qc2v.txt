Comment Value: Thank you so much for coming to do your medical. I think that it was a good investment of your time. I honestly think you take good care of your body and for that reason I think that you are doing a lot to manage the risk associated with high cholesterol. Please keep checking in with your GP to make sure its going in the right direction. There is an important place for screening as prevention is better than cure and early detection of cancer saves lives and prolonged difficult treatment protocols! I truly hope you benefited from our time together, it was lovely to meet you.
