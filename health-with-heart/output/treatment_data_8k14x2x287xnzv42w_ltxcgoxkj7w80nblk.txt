Comment Value: Mike, it was really nice meeting you.
Thank you for allowing us to see where we can make a difference in your wellbeing.
I spoke to Dr Francoise Pinnilos at our Wellbeing Centre and her recommendation has been for you to continue with the immunotherapy at Dr Marinda as this is quite a specialised treatment that Dr McDonald does. Please make this a priority as your chronic Sinusitis from your known allergies are quite significant.
Hope 2022 is one of health and healthy boundaries.
Hope to see you in the Wellbeing Centre quite soon.
