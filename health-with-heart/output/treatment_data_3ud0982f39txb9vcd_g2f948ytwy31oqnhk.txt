Comment Value: The main concern currently is that you have a microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Please check your iron levels with the lab form provided as well as a stool sample for any occult blood loss (blod loss from gut). We will follow up with the results, but strongly recommend that you see a Gastroenterologist for a screening colonoscopy and gastroscopy to exclude anything sinister and evaluate the lining of your stomach. The anaemia may well be the cause of your low energy levels and this needs to be addressed. You are always welcome at our Centre to discuss any of the above results with our doctors. We are here to support and guide you to best health!
