Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Vitamin D within normal limits at 26.2 but can be more optimal close to 50. Supplement for 3 months and review with a doctor.
2. Mildly decreased filtration rate. This is often due to being dehydrated and presenting fasting the morning of the blood tests. Follow this up in 2-3 months when well hydrated to monitor a trend.
3. Raised total and LDL cholesterol. This should improve when you manage to get back to a healthier diet. Omega3 or Glucochol22 supplements can also help bring this down.
4. Raised homocysteine. This is a marker for cardiovascular risk.  Lots of veggies or methylated B-vitamin supplements will help bring this down.
