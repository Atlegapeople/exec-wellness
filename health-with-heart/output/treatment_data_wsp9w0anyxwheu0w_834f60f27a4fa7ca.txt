Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) was high at 40 mm/hr. Normal ranges are between 2-28 mm/hr.  There are multiple causes eg. inflammation, chronic infection or auto-immune disease. This will require further investigation by your doctor.
2. Vitamin D level was low at 11.8 ng/ml.  The optimal ranges are between 50-60 ng/.  Vitamin D has aids in several functions eg. immunity, sleep, mood and bone/muscle health.  Increase intake of Vitamin D rich food and a good oral supplement.
3. HS CRP was elevated at 5.3 mg/ml.  Normal levels are <1 mg/ml.  The HS CRP is a marker that increases with inflammation/stress and thus has numerous possible causes for being raised.
