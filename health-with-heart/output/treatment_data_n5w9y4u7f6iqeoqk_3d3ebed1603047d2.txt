Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1.Your Vit D level is low at 18.1ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. See glossary for more info.
2.High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. Left untreated this can lead to type two diabetes. The most important factors to address to try to reverse this are to do with your lifestyle - namely your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose 10% of your body weight.
