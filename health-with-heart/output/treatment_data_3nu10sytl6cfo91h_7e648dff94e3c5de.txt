MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Denzil Ramen
Report Date: 2022-09-29
Doctor: Christie Pilossof
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Normal examination on the day.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to see you had normal PSA levels on your blood work. As you get older (>40 years) - routine screening becomes important to help early detection & management of any irregularities. In males, this means regular prostate examinations and PSA blood levels.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Denzil the main concerns identified today are your high fasting insulin levels and raised cholesterol. Please consider seeing a dietician/nutritionist to guide you with making dietary changes to try and reverse this. I suggest rechecking your insulin levels in 3 months and if they remain elevated please consult with us or your GP. I wish you all the best for the remainder of the year and we look forward to seeing you again next year.

Comment Value: 1.High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. The most important factors to address to reverse this are diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose weight.
2. Your total cholesterol/LDL is slightly high. Before we consider medication, make sure you follow a healthy diet: decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal fat and exercise regularly.  Supplements that may help include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg.
3. Your uric acid level is elevated. This is a risk factor for heart disease and gout. Ensure very good hydration to flush out uric acid and keep alcohol, red meat and fructose intake low.
4. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 21ng/ml. Supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
