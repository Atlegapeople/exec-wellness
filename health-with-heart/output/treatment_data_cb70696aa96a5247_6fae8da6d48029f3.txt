Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - The vit D level is insufficient. I recommend you supplement daily with Vitamin D 5000iu & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. 
- Fasting glucose was 6.5, this is above normal and given your family history of diabetes I recommend we do a glucose tolerance test to properly assess your body's response to glucose. Please discuss the result with your GP of choice.
- The cholesterol and triglycerides were above the acceptable range. Before we consider medication, make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products. Regular exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min is also important.  We usually give these interventions a good 3-6months before we review. After 3 months we can repeat the blood tests and reassess.

Comment Value: Keep up the good work with the consumption of fruit and veggies! Take active steps in decreasing the amount of saturated fats in your diet and add more good fats from seeds and fish. You have managed to stay away from cigarettes for 2 months, do keep in that stride!

Overview Notes: Thank you Jervay for doing your medical with us. Your overall health is well, keep up the good habits that you have in place. Over the next few months work on the changes we have spoken about to bring down the cholesterol. Supplement daily with vitamin D 5000iu. I hope your sleep will improve as your daughter becomes more independent as well. Please set up an appointment in 3 months time so we can repeat the cholesterol and vitamin D. Once you are ready also let us know and we can organise for you to do the glucose tolerance test.
