Comment Value: 1.Your cholesterol is high. Even if you decide not to take statins please continue to follow up with your doctor and monitor it.
2.Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 25 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 2000iu daily. Recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.

Lifestyle - namely your diet, exercise and stress reduction is the most important starting point to address this. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates. Exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week. Mention this to your gynae to monitor for potential gestational diabetes.
