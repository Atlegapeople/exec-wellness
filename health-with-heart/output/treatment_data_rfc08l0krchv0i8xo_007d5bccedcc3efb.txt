MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Dario Musso
Report Date: 2024-11-19
Doctor: 
Nurse: Ayabonga Msila
Clinical Recommendations: Your clinical examination was unremarkable, with no concerning findings. Regular mole-mapping with a dermatologist is recommended to screen for any suspicious lesions. Early detection of irregularities can significantly improve management outcomes.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular prostate screening, including PSA testing and clinical exams, becomes increasingly important with age. Your recent PSA levels (prostate marker) were normal, and you report no concerning symptoms. We will continue with routine screening.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: We discussed several areas that can be optimised to further improve your well-being. Building and maintaining healthy lifestyle habits can be challenging. However, the long-term benefits—such as improved energy, better mood, and reduced risk of illness—are truly worth the effort. 

We wish you a wonderful rest of the year, and we look forward to supporting you on your wellness journey in the New Year!

Comment Value: Your blood work showed slight elevations in a few markers, likely related to your recent cycling injury on your right leg. This explains the increase in the low-grade inflammatory marker (hs-CRP) and changes in blood cell counts, but there is no cause for concern. Your kidney function was slightly reduced, which is common when fasting or dehydrated at the time of the test, but again, nothing of concern. We were pleased to see that your Vitamin D levels are sufficient, and you can continue your current oral supplementation.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your blood work showed slight elevations in a few markers, likely related to your recent cycling injury on your right leg. This explains the increase in the low-grade inflammatory marker (hs-CRP) and changes in blood cell counts, but there is no cause for concern. Your kidney function was slightly reduced, which is common when fasting or dehydrated at the time of the test, but again, nothing of concern. We were pleased to see that your Vitamin D levels are sufficient, and you can continue your current oral supplementation.
