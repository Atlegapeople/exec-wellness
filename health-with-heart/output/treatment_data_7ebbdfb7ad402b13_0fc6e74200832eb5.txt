Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Full blood count - suggesting possible iron deficiency. I would suggest that you have blood taken for iron studies.
2. Vit D - Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
3. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 9.4 umol/l. You can bring this down by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Metagenics MethylCare (Wellness Warehouse/Faithful to Nature) & recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
4. Cholesterol: If other cardiovascular risk markers are very raised we may decide to treat this more aggressively with medication. But before we consider medication make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar and refined carbs.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for 30 min is also important. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg and Glucochol22.
