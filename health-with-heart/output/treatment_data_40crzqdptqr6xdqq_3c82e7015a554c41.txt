Women's Health Recommendations: Keep screening your pap smear every 1 -2 years.  Mammogram screening starts at 40 years old.
Overview Notes: Dear Dempho, thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen. There are no major red flags that need to be addressed immediately, rather refine your everyday lifestyle choices for improved future health. These adjustments take a good 3-6 months to show change. Repeat the tests that were abnormal after this time frame to review. It was a pleasure giving you feedback for your comprehensive medical! Dr Janine
Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Deficient Vitamin D. Supplement for 3 months and review with your doctor.
2. Mild decrease in kidney filtration.  Usually due to dehydration. Drink enough water and repeat in 3 months to monitor a trend.
3. Raised ongoing inflammation indicated by ultra-sensitive CRP.  This contributes to chronic illnesses in 5 - 10 years. To bring this down eat a freshly cooked healthy diet with your exercise, and reduce sugar. Try to increase quality sleep and manage stress.
4. Your fasting glucose is dipping below normal.  Be careful of not eating enough nutritious food while making an intermittent fasting window too long. This coupled with lots of sugar daily will in the long run predispose you to Diabetes Mellitus.
5. Your fasting insulin is borderline high normal meaning your body is already working hard to control your sugar levels. Be mindful of your diet as it is driving an unhealthy sugar metabolism which will break down.
