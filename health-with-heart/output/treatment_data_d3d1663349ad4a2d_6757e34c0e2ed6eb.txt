Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Kidney function decreased. Repeat eGFR 58, initially 65 on first eGFR. Normal electrolytes. Your urine protein:creatinine ratio was normal. Please see a nephrologist.
High cholesterol - Before we consider medication, make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products. We usually give these interventions a good 3-6months before we review. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg and Glucochol22.
hs-CRP raised - Avoid sugar, highly processed foods, toxins, stress etc. High quality Omega 3 (where the DHA and EPA components are >500mg) and Curcumin (Tumeric) are both excellent anti-inflammatory supplements.
Supplement Vit D as dicussed and repeat levels in 3/12.
