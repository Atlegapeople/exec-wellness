Instead of red meat, try fish high in omega-3 fatty acids — such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel or salmon. Avoid trans fats or foods with hydrogenated oils or fats.

-Exercise regularly. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most or all days of the week. Regular exercise can lower triglycerides and boost "good" cholesterol.

Overview Notes: Healthy lifestyle choices are key:
-Exercise regularly. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most or all days of the week. Regular exercise can lower triglycerides and boost "good" cholesterol. Try to incorporate more physical activity into your daily tasks — for example, climb the stairs at work or take a walk during breaks.
