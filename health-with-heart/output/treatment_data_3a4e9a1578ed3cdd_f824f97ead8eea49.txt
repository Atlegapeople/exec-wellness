Comment Value: 1. Normal Vitamin D levels but this can be more optimal.  Supplement for at least 3 months and review. 2.  A mildly reduced kidney filtration rate is usually due to being dehydrated, from being fasting, on the day.  Review when not fasting in about 3 months. 3. A raised uric acid can predispose you to gout, reduce alcohol and red meat to improve this. 4. Mildly raised cholesterol. Make the best choice possible when eating restaurant food daily. 5. Eat vegetables rich in B-vitamins to improve homocysteine.
