Comment Value: Gillian, it was such a pleasure to meet you.
You were told you were "pre-diabetic" last year and started on Glucophage. You have adjusted your diet accordingly and your Insulin levels have improved. Well done!
Your cholesterol levels are however very deranged and needs to be reviewed to see if initiation of any treatment is required. As well as your blood pressure.
A GP visit will be able to assist - you can visit your own or come to one of us at the Wellness Centre.
Your fatigue post COVID infection is affecting your day-day living. Please take the Quercetin I have suggested for you and review the effectiveness at your GP visit.
Mild hearing loss is present. You did however have wax in your one ear. It is recommended that you undergo a full audiological evaluation, and subsequently possible ENT referral if necessary. Enjoy your upcoming wedding!
Hope 2022 is a healthy, happy year for you and your husband!
