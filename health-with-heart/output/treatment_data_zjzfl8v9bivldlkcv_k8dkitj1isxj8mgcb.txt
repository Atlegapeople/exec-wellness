Overview Notes: Increased cholesterol: try to manage with lifestyle alone. Eat a healthy diet, continue your exercise, lose weight, and manage your stress. Supplement with 2g per day of omega 3. The level has not increased from last year though and your HDL "good cholesterol" has increased which is great, probably from your increased exercise.

The level has not increased from last year though and your HDL "good cholesterol" has increased which is great, probably from your increased exercise.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI and your waist circumference are high. Try to reduce your BMI to 25 and waist circumference to less than 88 cm.

Overview Notes: Increased cholesterol: try to manage with lifestyle alone. Eat a healthy diet, continue your exercise, lose weight, and manage your stress. Supplement with 2g per day of omega 3. The level has not increased from last year though and your HDL "good cholesterol" has increased which is great, probably from your increased exercise.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI and your waist circumference are high. Try to reduce your BMI to 25 and waist circumference to less than 88 cm.

Overview Notes: Increased cholesterol: try to manage with lifestyle alone. Eat a healthy diet, continue your exercise, lose weight, and manage your stress. Supplement with 2g per day of omega 3. The level has not increased from last year though and your HDL "good cholesterol" has increased which is great, probably from your increased exercise.

The level has not increased from last year though and your HDL "good cholesterol" has increased which is great, probably from your increased exercise.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI and your waist circumference are high. Try to reduce your BMI to 25 and waist circumference to less than 88 cm.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI and your waist circumference are high. Try to reduce your BMI to 25 and waist circumference to less than 88 cm.

Women's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are up-to-date with your screening (Mammogram/ Pap smear). Regular review helps to detect any abnormalities early & improves management outcomes. Another screening scan that to be done is a Bone Density. This can be done through any radiology department.
Overview Notes: Raised hsCRP: suggests increased levels of inflammation in the body which puts you at higher risk for heart disease and other chronic diseases. Things to consider to lower inflammation include a healthy mediterranean style diet, exercise, stress reduction, losing abdominal fat and supplementing with omega 3's and curcumin.

People who carry more weight around their mid section, are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI and your waist circumference are high. Try to reduce your BMI to 25 and waist circumference to less than 88 cm.
