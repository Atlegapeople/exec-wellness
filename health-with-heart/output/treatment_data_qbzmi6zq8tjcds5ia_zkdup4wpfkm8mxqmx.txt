Comment Value: Dinesh it was great meeting you and having the opportunity to be part of your wellness journey. Your cholesterol is well controlled and you exercise well and often. It is also important to prioritise rest. For you to function well and optimally in your corporate role and as the head of your family you need to prioritise rest and relaxation as well.
Meditation is also a good way of doing this. Nice apps to help you with this are "Insight timer" or "Headspace"
A holiday can also do wonders.
Take care and look forward to seeing you again next year.
