Comment Value: Overall you seem to be in excellent health which was reflected by your great blood results. The only abnormal result was your low TSH indicating that your euthyrox dose is a bit too high. Please pay attention to your stress levels and try to incorporate stress reduction techniques into your daily life. Have a wonderful holiday and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
