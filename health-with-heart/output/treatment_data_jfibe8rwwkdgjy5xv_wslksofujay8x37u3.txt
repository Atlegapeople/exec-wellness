Men's Health Recommendations: -After the age of 40 prostate screening becomes important. Frequent urination, straining to urinate & dribbling of urine are some signs to look out for. Your PSA at 0.28 is normal, this shows a low risk of prostate cancer.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Your BMI is in the Obesity range. We aim for a BMI of 25. That translates to a weight of 75 - 80kg. I believe you can achieve this. Physical activity has many benefits. It can help with anxiety, loosing weight, increasing your tissue sensitivity to insulin.
