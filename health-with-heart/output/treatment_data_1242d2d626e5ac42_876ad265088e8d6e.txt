Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D is within normal limits but can be more optimal. Supplement for 3 months with 1000iu (over the counter).  
2. Mild increase in total and LDL cholesterol.  Reduce restaurant foods and sugary foods.  Review in 6 months to monitor. Omega3 or Glucochol22 may help bring this down if not strongly familial. 
3. Your current ultra-sensitive CRP on this test is more reflective of an infection at the time.  A repeat is recommended to review for low grade chronic ongoing inflammation.
4. The reason for a raised homocysteine on your tests is unclear. Veggies rich in B-vitamins and/or taking methylated B vitamins will help bring this down. Review with a doctor in 3-6 months.
