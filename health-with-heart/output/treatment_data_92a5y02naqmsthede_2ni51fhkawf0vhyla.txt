You report a functional manageable baseline.

Clinical Recommendations: There were no current concerns on your examination. Regular screening of any skin lesions is recommended - ‘Mole Mapping’ can be done with a Dermatologist. If any changes in size/ shape/ colour of a skin mark - to seek medical review.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are following up with a Urologist (2 yearly). You mentioned still experiencing a few symptoms at night - hopefully with some habit adjustments (avoid fluids before bedtime) & continuing Betmiga this will improve. You report a functional manageable baseline.
