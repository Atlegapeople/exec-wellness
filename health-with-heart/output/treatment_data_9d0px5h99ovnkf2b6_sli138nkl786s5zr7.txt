Apart from the above pointers - your hearing was found to be affected and a full audiogram recommended. Your DHEA is also suppressed and this is also highlighting what we discussed in terms of too much "fight and flight" and too little "rest and digest".
Balance your diet, move more (this decreases anxiety and improves sleep) and practice mindfulness. You can considering supplementing with DHEA if no improvement with the above.
Prioritise yourself.
