Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Vitamin D levels are low at 19 ng/ml. Optimal Vit D levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Supplement with 50 000 IU Vit D3 weekly for at least 3 months and repeat the levels after this period.
2. HS CRP was raised and may be due to underlying inflammation or infection. Insulin resistance can contribute.
3. Fasting insulin levels are high. This means you are insulin resistant (a precursor for Diabetes).  This is still reversible! Please see a Dietician.
4. Low cortisol levels may be due to recent cortisone use or other causes. Repeat test in 2-3 months is advised.
