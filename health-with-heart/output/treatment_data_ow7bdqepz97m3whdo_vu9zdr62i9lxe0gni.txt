Comment Value: Thank you for doing a medical with us, it was lovely to meet you. You are aware of your health concerns and have already started losing weight, you are on all the treatment you need to be on and you follow up with your doctors. This is great. You also don't smoke! This is a big win. This medical will hopefully have been a good stock take and reminder that you need to invest in your health, way of life and routine. Exercise and stress management are going to be your focus initially, getting this right will change a lot for you. You are also due for a prostate exam and a colonoscopy, these are general screenings for cancer that are recommended at your age. I hope you this has been helpful, I wish you all the best in health!
