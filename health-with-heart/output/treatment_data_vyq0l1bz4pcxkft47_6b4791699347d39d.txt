Comment Value: Anoop overall you seem to be in good health. The only concerns are your above optimal homocysteine level, suboptimal vitamin D level and your increased waist circumference. Supplement with B vitamins or a good multivitamin and vitamin D. You can repeat your vitamin D, B12 level and homocysteine levels in 3 to 4 months. Try to increase your activity levels which have reduced during lockdown as this will help you to keep your weight and waist circumference in check. We look forward to seeing you again next year!
