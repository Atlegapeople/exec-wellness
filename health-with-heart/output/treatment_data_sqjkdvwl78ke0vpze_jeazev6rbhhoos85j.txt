Comment Value: Optimising your vitamin D level is important. This is not only important for bone health but for over a 100 different processes in your body. Vitamin D functions like a hormone and is important for general wellbeing, cognitive function, preventing certain cancers and reducing inflammation. Lowering homocysteine will help to keep cardiovascular disease risk in check. Your menstrual irregularities are most likely due to the natural transition to perimenopause. As discussed there are a few options to try to regulate your cycles and ease the transition. Hormone testing can be done to confirm perimenopause. Overall you seem to be in very good health and I commend you on your healthy lifestyle.
