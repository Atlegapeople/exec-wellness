Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Chronic medication and anti-inflammatories can decrease kidney filtration. I recommend repeating the kidney function test with a doctor in 3 months and when well hydrated. We may have to investigate further if it is still decreased in 3 months.
2. Mildly raised uric acid. Monitor and visit a doctor if you have specific joint pains - it could be gout.
3. Mild inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP. Stress management, good sleep and diet with exercise help keep this low.
4. Raised homocysteine.  Methylated B-vitamins will help reduce this.  Follow up in 3-6 months.
5. Raised fasting insulin.  Increase the intensity of your daily exercise and review in 3-6 months. Medication as a last resort may help if lifestyle does not improve this.
