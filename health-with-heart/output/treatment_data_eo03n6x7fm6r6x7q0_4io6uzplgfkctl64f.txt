Overview Notes: Decrease BMI and waist circumference to less than 80cm. We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.

People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.

Overview Notes: Decrease BMI and waist circumference to less than 80cm. We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.
