MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Ravana Chetty
Report Date: 2022-09-20
Doctor: Carla Marais
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Mild hearing loss bilaterally on Audiology Screen. Please do a full audiogram to determine the nature of the hearing loss.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a gynaecologists for a Pap smear and a Radiologist for a mammogram
Overview Notes: Ravana thank you for coming for your medical.
You have a great diet and try to do all the right things. Your exercise routine has changed in the last year. You have gained a bit of weight and your body fat percentage is significantly raised.
I think a Biokineticist review to assist in moving more efficiently and a Dietician to review your diet is not a bad idea.
The most pressing matter though is the changes seen in your Stress ECG. Please see the cardiologist as referred. 
Hope the rest of 2022 is a healthy one.

Clinical Recommendations: Mild hearing loss bilaterally on Audiology Screen. Please do a full audiogram to determine the nature of the hearing loss.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a gynaecologists for a Pap smear and a Radiologist for a mammogram
Overview Notes: Ravana thank you for coming for your medical.
You have a great diet and try to do all the right things. Your exercise routine has changed in the last year. You have gained a bit of weight and your body fat percentage is significantly raised.
I think a Biokineticist review to assist in moving more efficiently and a Dietician to review your diet is not a bad idea.
The most pressing matter though is the changes seen in your Stress ECG. Please see the cardiologist as referred. 
Hope the rest of 2022 is a healthy one.
