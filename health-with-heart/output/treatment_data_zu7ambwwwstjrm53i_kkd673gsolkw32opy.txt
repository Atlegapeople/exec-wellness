Comment Value: The main concerns currently are type 2 diabetes, hypertension, mildly raised cholesterol and a high BMI. All of these concerns can be better managed through an improvement in lifestyle factors - better nutrition, exercise and very importantly stress reduction. As we discussed it's not always easy to make changes to our lifestyle, especially when it comes to work related stress, however i strongly encourage you to put yourself and your health first and strat with some small changes (and a holiday!) . It was lovely to meet you and we look forward to seeing you again.
