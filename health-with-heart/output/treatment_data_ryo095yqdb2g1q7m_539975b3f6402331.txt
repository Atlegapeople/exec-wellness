Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: - HsCRP (chronic inflammatory marker) is high which puts you at risk for cardiovascular disease. Stress or a recent infection can contribute to this. Please repeat in 6 weeks.
- "Bad" cholesterol is high & the “good” cholesterol - HDL - is low. This can be remedied by avoiding saturated and trans fats, eating health fats e.g. omega 3 fatty acids, replacing refined carbohyrates with high-fibre foods and exercising frequently. Supplements such as GlucoChol22 and Rychol may help.
- Liver function tests were also deranged could be secondary to the high cholesterol - suggest getting an abdominal ultrasound to check the liver.
- Homocysteine high - optimum level is <7umol/l.  This can be optimised by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
