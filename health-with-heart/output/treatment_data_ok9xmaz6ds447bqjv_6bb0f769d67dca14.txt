Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly raised ALT (a liver enzyme) may be due to medication, toxins or fatty liver disease. Try losing weight around the abdomen and limit alcohol. If levels remain high, consider an abdominal ultrasound. 
2. Slightly raised Urate (linked to gout and heart disease). Limit purine rich food and sugar (especially fructose).
3. HS CRP was slightly raised and may be due to underlying inflammation/infection. Insulin resistance can contribute.
4. High cholesterol & Triglycerides. Limit processed food, refined carbohydrates and sugar. 
5. Very high fasting Insulin levels indicates you have Insulin resistance (which can lead to Diabetes if not managed).
