Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. Left untreated this can lead to type two diabetes. The most important factors to address to try to reverse this are your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose 10% of your body weight.
2. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 30ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 4000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
3. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 9 umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. eg. Metagenics MethylCare or phytomulti. Aim for 7 umol/l. See glossary for more info.
