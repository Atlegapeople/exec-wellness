Overview Notes: Urology referral: This is yet another 'coming of age' appropriate referral. While you have no symptoms of an enlarged prostate and have a very low PSA (blood marker), it is prudent for a urology review at the age of 50. Klarli has Dr Gellman's details to schedule this appointment which shouldn't be more than a quick visit.

Overview Notes: All of your bloods excepting for a non specific inflammatory marker were pristine and in the optimal range. The hsCRP (inflammatory marker) was raised at 6, where we would like it to be as close to zero as possible. This elevation may be related to your rib injury. I would like to repeat this test after 6 weeks in the first week of March please.

While you have no symptoms of an enlarged prostate and have a very low PSA (blood marker), it is prudent for a urology review at the age of 50. Klarli has Dr Gellman's details to schedule this appointment which shouldn't be more than a quick visit.

The hsCRP (inflammatory marker) was raised at 6, where we would like it to be as close to zero as possible. This elevation may be related to your rib injury. I would like to repeat this test after 6 weeks in the first week of March please.

Overview Notes: Urology referral: This is yet another 'coming of age' appropriate referral. While you have no symptoms of an enlarged prostate and have a very low PSA (blood marker), it is prudent for a urology review at the age of 50. Klarli has Dr Gellman's details to schedule this appointment which shouldn't be more than a quick visit.

Overview Notes: Colonoscopy: At the age of 50, we recommend a screening colonoscopy and gastroscopy to detect any changes that present a future risk for cancer. This can be done with Dr Kassianides at Morningside. Details provided to Klarli to book. This will have you off work for a day and a half. You have no risk factors on history or clinical examination making this urgent.
