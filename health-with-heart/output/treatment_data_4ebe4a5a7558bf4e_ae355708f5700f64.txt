MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Francios Ferreira
Report Date: 2024-01-17
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Clinically you examine well with no current concerns. An increased body fat % can be reduced with finding a good exercise rhythm. If there is any future concern for skin lesions/ moles - we recommend mole mapping.
Men's Health Recommendations: Regular screening for your Prostate gland is important as you get older, in order to detect any abnormalities early. I am glad to see that your PSA (prostate marker) levels were normal on your blood work.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: You have recently been through a stressful season but have found the support you’ve needed. I am glad to hear that things have been improving. 

We are here to help in whatever way we can to improve your wellbeing and physical health. We can follow-up your repeat blood levels in a few months time. 

Making some of the lifestyle changes we discussed can be challenging, but worth while in the long run. Keep going!

I hope the rest of your year goes well. 

Warm regards,

Comment Value: Your cholesterol, urate and fasting insulin levels were all slightly raised. We can monitor and repeat blood work in 4-6 months. Improved diet (reduce red meat, sugar, alcohol) and exercise can help improve these levels. Your Vit D was also low. We can supplement this and repeat levels with your next blood tests.
