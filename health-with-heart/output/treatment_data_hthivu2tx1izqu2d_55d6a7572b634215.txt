Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your vitamin D is within normal range but can be more optimal. Supplement for 3 months and review.
2. Decreased kidney filtration most likely due to dehydration on the day. Monitor in 2-3 months on a day when not fasting and well hydrated.
3. Raised uric acid. Drink enough water and do not eat excessive amounts of fruit, red meat or alcohol. See a doctor for an acutely painful joint - it may be gout when this happens.
4. Raised total and LDL cholesterol. Trial Omega 3, Rhychol or Glucochol22 for 3 months and review. If not improving you may need medication. Discuss with your doctor.
5. Mildly raised inflammation on ultra-sensitive CRP.  Lifestyle impacts this and should get better when you are able to manage sleep better again.
