Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Cholesterol levels: try to manage this better with lifestyle. Once lifestyle has been optimised, we can consider weaning your statin. Take omega 3 supplements 2g daily and coQ10 supplement. CoQ10 is depleted with age and especially by Statin drugs. It is an enzyme necessary for energy production in the cell. Repeat bloods after 3 months.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Try to lose some weight, especially around your waist to reduce this risk.

Overview Notes: Cholesterol levels: try to manage this better with lifestyle. Once lifestyle has been optimised, we can consider weaning your statin. Take omega 3 supplements 2g daily and coQ10 supplement. CoQ10 is depleted with age and especially by Statin drugs. It is an enzyme necessary for energy production in the cell. Repeat bloods after 3 months.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Try to lose some weight, especially around your waist to reduce this risk.

Higher uric acid levels don't only predispose you to gout, they also increase your risk for a cardiac event.

Overview Notes: Cholesterol levels: try to manage this better with lifestyle. Once lifestyle has been optimised, we can consider weaning your statin. Take omega 3 supplements 2g daily and coQ10 supplement. CoQ10 is depleted with age and especially by Statin drugs. It is an enzyme necessary for energy production in the cell. Repeat bloods after 3 months.

Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, known as 'apple-shape', are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Try to lose some weight, especially around your waist to reduce this risk.

Overview Notes: Uric acid: reduce red meat and alcohol consumption. Seeing a dietician may help with this. Higher uric acid levels don't only predispose you to gout, they also increase your risk for a cardiac event. Suboptimal vitamin D level: supplement with vitamin D3 5000 and repeat level in 3 to 6 months

Overview Notes: Cholesterol levels: try to manage this better with lifestyle. Once lifestyle has been optimised, we can consider weaning your statin. Take omega 3 supplements 2g daily and coQ10 supplement. CoQ10 is depleted with age and especially by Statin drugs. It is an enzyme necessary for energy production in the cell. Repeat bloods after 3 months.
