Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Anaemia noted on full blood count - probable iron deficiency due to heavy periods. Please check iron levels and see gynae.
2. Your Vit D level is low at 12ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance.
3. Slightly reduced kidney function - lets repeat and check urine for protein.
4. High levels of inflammation noted. Try to reduce stress, remove sugar, refined carbs and processed food from diet, start exercising and try to lose some weight. Omega 3 and curcumin supplements can also help.
5. High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. Left untreated this can lead to type two diabetes. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose 10% of your body weight. Start glucophage and follow up in 6 weeks.
