Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Overall you have a good baseline with no concerns. You report been mildly sick on the day your bloods were taken - this likely accounts for the raised inflammatory marker (hsCRP) & will return to normal once the viral infection is cleared. You were also fasting with this blood panel - leading to a slight raise in renal markers. With good hydration this should correct itself.
