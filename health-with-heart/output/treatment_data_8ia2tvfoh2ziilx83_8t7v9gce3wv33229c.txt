Overview Notes: Stress and anxiety have a negative impact on our physical health and wellbeing. You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

Overview Notes: Stress and anxiety have a negative impact on our physical health and wellbeing. You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

Overview Notes: Stress and anxiety have a negative impact on our physical health and wellbeing. You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

Overview Notes: Stress and anxiety have a negative impact on our physical health and wellbeing. You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

Overview Notes: Stress and anxiety have a negative impact on our physical health and wellbeing. You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

Overview Notes: Stress and anxiety have a negative impact on our physical health and wellbeing. You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

Overview Notes: Stress and anxiety have a negative impact on our physical health and wellbeing. You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.

You have a high powered stressful job, and then you do large amounts of endurance training which also adds stress to the body. Whilst exercise is usually a good way of coping with stress and anxiety, endurance exercise can sometimes contribute to stress and less sleep/rest.
