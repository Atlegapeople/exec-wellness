Women's Health Recommendations: I am glad to hear that you are up-to-date with your screening (Mammogram/ Pap smear). Regular review helps to detect any abnormalities early & improves management outcomes. Another screening scan that to be done is a Bone Density. This can be done through any radiology department.
Overview Notes: We use body mass index (BMI) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) to assess the distribution of excess body fat. People who carry more weight around their mid section, are at higher risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Your BMI and your waist circumference are high. Try to reduce your BMI to 25 and waist circumference to 80 cm.
