2. Lower than expected kidney filtration most likely due to dehydration (being fasted that morning after a gym session). If improved on a repeat test on a non fasting, well hydrated day then it is not worrying.
3. Mildly raised total and LDL cholesterol. Decrease to lean red meat 1-2x a week. Trial Omega3/Rhychol/Glucochol22. Review in 3-6 months with a doctor.
