Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is very low at 10 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
2. Your GFR which is a calculation of kidney function may be normal or may indicate slightly reduced kidney function. Please repeat your kidney function test in 3 months and be cautious with taking anti-inflammatory pain medication.
3. Your total cholesterol/LDL  are marginally above the normal reference range. This does not warrant medication currently but make sure you follow a healthy diet with lots of veggies, decrease sugar, refined carbs and animal products.  Regular exercise 3-5x a week for a minimum of 30 min is also important. Over the counter supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega3, Rhychol, Niacin 100mg and Glucochol22.
