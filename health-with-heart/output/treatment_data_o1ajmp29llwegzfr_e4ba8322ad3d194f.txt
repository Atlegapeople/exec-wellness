Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Mildly reduced white cell count in isolation not worrying but will most likely improve once we initiate medication for you. 2. Low Vitamin D levels. Supplement for at least 3 months and review. 3. Your kidney filtration rate was reduced on the day but this is usually acutely affected by being dehydrated and training on the day. This will be part of your monitoring going forward and will most likely improve. 4. Mildly deranged liver function tests - perhaps due to exogenous testosterone? 5. Raised testosterone due to supplementation.
