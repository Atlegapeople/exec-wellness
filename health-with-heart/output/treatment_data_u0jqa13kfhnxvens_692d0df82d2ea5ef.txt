Comment Value: FBC: MCV = 94.4 (insignificant increase of 0.3). Monocytes slightly low (0.29. normal range 0.33-0.97).  rest of fbc normal.
eGFR=87 , normal urea/creat

Fe studies done due to patient requesting the test. His brother has iron overload and he was worried that he may also have the condition.

Fe studies:
Iron=17 normal
Transferrin=2.5 normal
Ferritin=393 HIGH (normal= 20-250)
Pt reassured that though ferritin was high, the transferring and transferrin % saturation was normal, thus unlikely to have iron overload. Informed that the ferritin can increase after acute infection (considering he reported having sinusitis a week ago)
Advised him to repeat the test in 2 months.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D levels are suboptimal at 26 ng/ml. The laboratory reports values of > 20ng/ml as sufficient and optimal levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Take a good vitamin D3 supplement of at least 2000 IU daily and increase intake of Vit D rich foods eg oily fish.
2. The iron studies showed high ferritin (stored iron) levels. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant that also increases with infection and inflammation. Due to the rest of the iron studies being normal it is unlikely that you have iron overload. With iron overload the ferritin ranges at 2000-3000 ng/ml. Your level was 393ng/ml. I recommend that the test be repeated in 2 months.
