Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Low lymphocytes noted on full blood count. May be due to infection. Please retest when feeling well.
2. Raised GGT liver enzyme - most likely due to high alcohol consumption. Please cut down your drinking to maximum of 1 to 2 units daily and preferably not every day. Supplementing with milk thistle or glutathione can support your liver.
3. Raised total cholesterol and very high triglyceride levels. A common cause of high triglycerides is alcohol abuse so please watch your intake.
4. High uric acid can lead to gout and increase risk for heart disease. Please reduce alcohol and red meat and drink lots of water.

Overview Notes: Chris it was a pleasure to do your medical today. Many of the concerns identified on your blood results suggest that you are drinking more alcohol than you should - raised liver enzymes, very high triglycerides and high uric acid levels. Please be mindful of this and try to reduce your intake. Please monitor your blood pressure as it is at the upper limit of normal. If it remains high you may need to consider medication. I wish you a happy and healthy remainder of 2022.
