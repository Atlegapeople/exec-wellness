Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Moderately low lymphocytes noted on full blood count - possibly related to NHL. Follow up with haematologist in Dec.
2. Suboptimal vitamin D levels despite calciferol. I would recommend changing to D3 supplement 5000iu daily and recheck level in 4 to 6 months aiming for 50 to 80ng/ml.
3. hsCRP (inflammatory marker) falls into average risk category for heart disease. Try to follow a healthy diet, reduce sugar and stress and increase exercise.
4. Your homocysteine level is normal but optimal would be a bit lower (around 7) - supplement with a good B complex with the B vitamins in their active form e.g. phytomulti from metagenics.
5. Insulin levels within normal but above optimal - can reduce  by decreasing sugar, refined carbohydrates and stress and increase exercise.
