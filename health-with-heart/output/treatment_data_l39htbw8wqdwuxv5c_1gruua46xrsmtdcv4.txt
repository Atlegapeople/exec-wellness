Comment Value: Keith it was nice meeting you and having the opportunity to spend some time looking at ways we can optimise your health.
The last 2 years have brought a change in your routine - You have become less active and have increased the amount of alcohol that is being consumed.
Your cholesterol can be brought down by healthy lifestyle choices - which you are more than able to achieve.
Exercise and decreased wine and coffee intake can also assist in decreasing anxiety and improving sleep.
Your liver functions and renal testing can be done at your own GP or you are more than welcome to come see one of us at the Wellness Centre.
Hope 2022 is a healthy year for you!
