Comment Value: 1. Mildly enlarged red blood cells on full blood count can be due to daily alcohol intake or a B12 deficiency. The latter is unlikely (your reported diet is good). Reduce your daily glass of wine and review in 2-3 months.
2. Your vitamin D is within normal limits but can be more optimal. Supplement and review in 3 months.
3. Raised total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. This may be genetic as you live a good lifestyle. Trial one of Omega3, Rhychol or Glucochol for 3 - 6 months.  If still elevated we may have to start chronic medication.

3. Raised total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. This may be genetic as you live a good lifestyle. Trial one of Omega3, Rhychol or Glucochol for 3 - 6 months.  If still elevated we may have to start chronic medication.
