Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to see you had normal PSA levels on your blood work. As you get older (>40 years) - routine screening becomes important to help early detection & management of any irregularities. In males, this means regular prostate examinations and PSA blood levels.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you have been building some good lifestyle habits since last year. Keep going! Building healthy practices & lifestyle changes can have a big impact. It takes time to develop but they can help prevent future illness & any cardiovascular risk. 

Hopefully your cholesterol levels improve with some changes in diet and supplements. We will monitor your levels & determine the need for further management.

Clinical Recommendations: You have no current concerns on your clinical examination. If any symptoms or signs arise - to seek medical review from your GP.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to see you had normal PSA levels on your blood work. As you get older (>40 years) - routine screening becomes important to help early detection & management of any irregularities. In males, this means regular prostate examinations and PSA blood levels.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you have been building some good lifestyle habits since last year. Keep going! Building healthy practices & lifestyle changes can have a big impact. It takes time to develop but they can help prevent future illness & any cardiovascular risk. 

Hopefully your cholesterol levels improve with some changes in diet and supplements. We will monitor your levels & determine the need for further management.
