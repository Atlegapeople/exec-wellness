Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Slightly low neutrophil count (type of white blood cell) - maybe due to an underlying viral infection or can be normal in african populations.
2. Slightly high LDL cholesterol - does not require medication but ensure a healthy diet with lots of veg, low sugar and refined carbs and continue exercising. Monitor levels annually.  
3. High uric acid. This is a risk factor for heart disease and gout. Please ensure very good hydration to help flush out uric acid and reduce red meat to 2 to 3 times a week.
4. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 28.3ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 2000iu daily & recheck your level in 4 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
