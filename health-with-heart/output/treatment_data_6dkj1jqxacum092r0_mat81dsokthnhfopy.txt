Comment Value: Glenn it was a pleasure to meet you and do your medical today. Overall your results were all normal apart from the slightly raised cholesterol. With your family history of heart disease it's prudent that you pay attention to this and your lifestyle to ensure that you remain healthy. I hope that this information will help you and motivate you to have an active and healthy 2022.

Overview Notes: Your fasting insulin falls within the normal range but is at the upper limit. A raised fasting insulin level can be the first indication of insulin resistance and prediabetes. To reduce this to a more optimal level pay attention to reducing sugar and starchy carbohydrates in your diet, continue to exercise and manage your stress levels.
