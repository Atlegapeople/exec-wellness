MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Tswelopele Kodisang
Report Date: 2023-12-01
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Your general exam did not pick up any red flags. Your systems exam was unremarkable and you appear in general good health. You had one high BP reading. With BP being dynamic and this a snapshot, we need more data - please see note under Vitals.
Men's Health Recommendations: I suggest that you have a prostate ultrasound as part of routine preventative screening when you hit 50yrs of age. Your PSA was in range and you have no other red flags.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you’ve been building some positive healthy lifestyle habits. Sustainably maintaining these changes will greatly benefit not only your current health but also your long term wellbeing. We identified a few areas that can be optimised and have started treatment for your high cholesterol. This we can follow-up in the new year. 

Keep working towards your current goals. We are here to help you in whatever way we can on your health journey.

Have a restful holiday and happy year ahead!

Warm regards,
Dr Jessica Koen

Clinical Recommendations: You’ve been able to maintain a good weight with regular exercise & a healthy diet. This will reduce your risk for future illness (such a hypertension). Keep going with these lifestyle habits. Your hearing test detected some hearing loss - recommended full audiogram (see report).
Men's Health Recommendations: I suggest that you have a prostate ultrasound as part of routine preventative screening when you hit 50yrs of age. Your PSA was in range and you have no other red flags.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you’ve been building some positive healthy lifestyle habits. Sustainably maintaining these changes will greatly benefit not only your current health but also your long term wellbeing. We identified a few areas that can be optimised and have started treatment for your high cholesterol. This we can follow-up in the new year. 

Keep working towards your current goals. We are here to help you in whatever way we can on your health journey.

Have a restful holiday and happy year ahead!

Comment Value: Your bloods showed persistent raised cholesterol levels. You’ve already made the lifestyle changes & attempted supplement use. However we need to add a low dose statin to your management. We can repeat levels in 3/12 to monitor their effect. You also had Low Vit D levels. We can supplement this and repeat levels on next bloods. The reduced renal filtration is likely due to dehydration (fasting bloods). But we will review on your next blood work done.

Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Your general exam did not pick up any red flags. Your systems exam was unremarkable and you appear in general good health. You had one high BP reading. With BP being dynamic and this a snapshot, we need more data - please see note under Vitals.
Men's Health Recommendations: I suggest that you have a prostate ultrasound as part of routine preventative screening when you hit 50yrs of age. Your PSA was in range and you have no other red flags.
Women's Health Recommendations:

Sustainably maintaining these changes will greatly benefit not only your current health but also your long term wellbeing. We identified a few areas that can be optimised and have started treatment for your high cholesterol. This we can follow-up in the new year. 

Keep working towards your current goals. We are here to help you in whatever way we can on your health journey.

Clinical Recommendations: You’ve been able to maintain a good weight with regular exercise & a healthy diet. This will reduce your risk for future illness (such a hypertension). Keep going with these lifestyle habits. Your hearing test detected some hearing loss - recommended full audiogram (see report).
Men's Health Recommendations: I suggest that you have a prostate ultrasound as part of routine preventative screening when you hit 50yrs of age. Your PSA was in range and you have no other red flags.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall you’ve been building some positive healthy lifestyle habits.

Report Date: 2023-12-01
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Your general exam did not pick up any red flags. Your systems exam was unremarkable and you appear in general good health. You had one high BP reading. With BP being dynamic and this a snapshot, we need more data - please see note under Vitals.
Men's Health Recommendations: Routine male screening includes review of the prostate gland. Your recent PSA levels (a prostate marker) on your blood work were normal. This screening is important as it helps early detection & management of any irregularities.
Women's Health Recommendations:
