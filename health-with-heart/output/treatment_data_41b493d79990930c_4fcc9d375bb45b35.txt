Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vitamin D is normal but can be more optimal towards 50.  Supplement 2-3 x a week and review with your next set of blood tests.
2. Your total cholesterol and LDL is still very high.  You have made a great effort to reduce it already but the results show that it is probably high due to genetics.  As discussed start a statin and review in 3 - 6 months. Given your family history a cardiologist review will be beneficial.
3. Raised inflammation levels based on ultra sensitive CRP. Improve sleep and exercise. Supplement with curcumin. Review in 3 - 6 months.
4. Homocysteine improved! Keep going with the homocysteine modulating supplement.
5. Oestrogen low signifying menopause. Keep your appointment with Dr Magan for review.
6. Impaired adrenal response. Manage lifestyle factors and review with Dr Magan.
