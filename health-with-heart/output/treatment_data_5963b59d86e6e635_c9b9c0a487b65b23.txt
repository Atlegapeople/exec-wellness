Women's Health Recommendations: Very Heavy periods, being managed by her gynae - hoping to go for an ablation.
Overview Notes: Rebone it was such a pleasure to do your medical today. You are struggling with your very heavy periods&iron deficiency anaemia as a result of them. Continue to take your iron supplements&consider an iron infusion. Continue eating liver a few times a week as well as red meat&your greens. I hope that the medical aid authorises the ablation and that you find some relief. You are otherwise in good health. I encourage you to get back to exercising, especially as you say you love it. Start slowly and build it up.
Comment Key: SpecialInvestigationRecommendation
Comment Value: Your body fat percentage is high. You mention that you stopped exercising and have gained weight and that when you tried to run now it hurts your knees. Try walking and building up slowly and if possible see the bio for knee strengthening exercises.
