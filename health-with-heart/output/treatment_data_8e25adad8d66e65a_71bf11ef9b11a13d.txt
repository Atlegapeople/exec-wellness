Electrical alternans and peaked t waves, indicative of hyperkalaemia.

My medical opinion: 
Electrical alternans is a normal finding and occurs with respiration. The T waves on his ECG does not meet  criteria for hyperkalaemia, as the T wave amplitude is <5mm in limb leads and < 10 mm in precordial leads. I thus reported the ECG as normal.

Comment Value: 1. FBC showed slightly low white blood cell counts which suggests a recent viral infection. This is not concerning and the test does not need to be repeated.
2. GGT (a liver enzyme) was high and can be due to alcohol use, toxins, medication or infection. Repeat test in 2 months is advised.
3. Vitamin D levels are suboptimal at 25.6 ng/ml. The laboratory reports values of > 20ng/ml as sufficient and optimal levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Take a good vitamin D3 supplement of at least 2000 IU daily and increase intake of Vit D rich foods eg oily fish.
