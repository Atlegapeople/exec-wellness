Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Raised GGT (mild) usually in keeping with alcohol consumption.  Reduce alcohol and repeat the test in 3 months.
2. Mild raised total cholesterol. Reduce red meat to 1-2x a week and reduce sugar intake. Review in 3-6months.
3. Very raised ultra-sensitive CRP (inflammation) which at this level is more an indication of an infection at the time of the blood tests. It is recommended to repeat the test when feeling well so that we can interpret this appropriately as a cardiovascular risk marker.
4. Raised cortisol level. Meditation/prayer and actively destressing every day should help improve this.  Review in 3-6 months to monitor.
