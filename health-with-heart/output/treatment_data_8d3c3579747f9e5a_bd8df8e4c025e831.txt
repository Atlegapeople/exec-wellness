MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Peter Watson
Report Date: 2023-09-13
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: Your blood pressure was marginally high on multiple readings. It improved to normal levels when you were calm (126/83). Managing your stress levels will help maintain lower readings. We will continue to monitor this.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to see your PSA levels were normal on your blood work. Regular prostate screening is important for early detection of any abnormalities as you get older & improves management outcomes. You can monitor for any symptoms & consult for further review if concerned.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: There were a few areas that we identified that can be optimised in order to improve your current general health as well as prevent future chronic illness. Building healthy practices & lifestyle changes can have a big impact. It takes time to develop these habits - but keep going!

You can re-test your blood levels (as discussed above) in 4/12 - in order to monitor for improvement & optimise your management. 

Warm regards,

Comment Value: The blood work done showed a slightly high cholesterol level. This can be improved with diet & exercise. Certain supplements can also have a positive effect - Omega 3 and RyChol. We can repeat levels again in a few months to determine the need for future treatment. HsCRP is a marker for future cardiovascular risk. Yours showed a current medium risk. This will improve with the lifestyle habits we discussed.

Clinical Recommendations: Your blood pressure was marginally high on multiple readings. It improved to normal levels when you were calm (126/83). Managing your stress levels will help maintain lower readings. We will continue to monitor this.
Men's Health Recommendations: I am glad to see your PSA levels were normal on your blood work. Regular prostate screening is important for early detection of any abnormalities as you get older & improves management outcomes. You can monitor for any symptoms & consult for further review if concerned.

Comment Value: Sleep quality & exercise play big role in managing stressful seasons. Your struggle with sleep over the past years may affect your energy levels and mood, but on-going attempts to improve this will help. Forming a regular exercise routine has also shown many benefits.

Comment Value: Your body fat % was high & baseline fitness low. These can all slowly be improved with the lifestyle habits we discussed. Your ECG had a few electrical variations. We can monitor for any symptoms to investigate further. Otherwise you report a good clinical baseline.
