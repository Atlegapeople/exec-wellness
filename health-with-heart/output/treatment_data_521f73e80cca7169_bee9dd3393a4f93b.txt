Overview Notes: Jannal it seems that you have struggled with endometriosis for a long time and it is now relatively well controlled by taking Visanne but this has caused weight gain. I would encourage you to continue with your exercise and to follow a low sugar low carb diet as your fasting insulin is high. Please restart glucophage XR too, to help bring this down. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you well with your op next week.

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Your Vit D level is low at 13ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. 
2. High fasting insulin levels may be an indication of prediabetes. The most important factors to address to try to reverse this relate to lifestyle - namely your diet, exercise and stress reduction. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose 10% of your body weight. Restart glucophage.
3. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is above optimal at 11 umol/l. You can reduce this by supplementing with methylated B vitamins e.g. Metagenics MethylCare & recheck the level in 6 months. Aim for <7 umol/l. 
4. High cholesterol - focus on lifestyle for now and recheck annually.

Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Normal clinical examination on the day.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Large fibroadenoma in left breast being removed on 05/09/22.
Overview Notes: Jannal it seems that you have struggled with endometriosis for a long time and it is now relatively well controlled by taking Visanne but this has caused weight gain. I would encourage you to continue with your exercise and to follow a low sugar low carb diet as your fasting insulin is high. Please restart glucophage XR too, to help bring this down. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you well with your op next week.
