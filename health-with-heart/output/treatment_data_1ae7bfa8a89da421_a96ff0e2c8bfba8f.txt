Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: The low Vitamin D levels shown on your bloods can be supplemented & levels repeated in 3/12. You had a high fasting insulin value which puts you at high risk for developing future diabetes. Adjusting your diet (reducing refined carbs/ sugar intake/ increasing vegetable variety) as well as weight loss, will help improve this. Your inflammatory markers were also raised - this is likely due to a mild infection at the time your bloods were take (ie. Flu).
