Comment Value: 1. Slightly low white cell count and neutrophils possibly due to sinus infection you had at the time of the bloods or it can also be normal for african people.
2. Your Vit D level is suboptimal at 22ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions.
