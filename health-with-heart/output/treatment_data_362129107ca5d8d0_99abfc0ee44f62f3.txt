MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Emily Mbele
Report Date: 2022-07-07
Doctor: Janine Silberbauer
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Normal examination on the day.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Visit a general practitioner or a gynaecologist for a Pap smear and a Radiologist for a mammogram.
Overview Notes: Dear Emily thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen.  You have a significant family history of chronic illness.  You have managed to decrease some of this risk by generally leading a good lifestyle.
Points to work on are sleep and decreasing sugar.  These are the two obvious drivers of ongoing moderate levels of background inflammation (your ultra sensitive CRP).  This in turn increases your cardiovascular risk for heart attacks and strokes.
Your vitamin D is normal but can be more optimal closer to 50.  I would advise that you take a Vitamin D3 supplement every second or third day to boost these levels.
It was a pleasure giving you feedback, we look forward to seeing you again next year!

Overview Notes: Dear Emily thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen.  You have a significant family history of chronic illness.  You have managed to decrease some of this risk by generally leading a good lifestyle.
Points to work on are sleep and decreasing sugar.  These are the two obvious drivers of ongoing moderate levels of background inflammation (your ultra sensitive CRP).  This in turn increases your cardiovascular risk for heart attacks and strokes.
Your vitamin D is normal but can be more optimal closer to 50.  I would advise that you take a Vitamin D3 supplement every second or third day to boost these levels.
It was a pleasure giving you feedback, we look forward to seeing you again next year!

Overview Notes: Dear Emily thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen.  You have a significant family history of chronic illness.  You have managed to decrease some of this risk by generally leading a good lifestyle.
Points to work on are sleep and decreasing sugar.  These are the two obvious drivers of ongoing moderate levels of background inflammation (your ultra sensitive CRP).  This in turn increases your cardiovascular risk for heart attacks and strokes.
Your vitamin D is normal but can be more optimal closer to 50.  I would advise that you take a Vitamin D3 supplement every second or third day to boost these levels.

Overview Notes: Dear Emily thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen.  You have a significant family history of chronic illness.  You have managed to decrease some of this risk by generally leading a good lifestyle.
Points to work on are sleep and decreasing sugar.  These are the two obvious drivers of ongoing moderate levels of background inflammation (your ultra sensitive CRP).  This in turn increases your cardiovascular risk for heart attacks and strokes.
Your vitamin D is normal but can be more optimal closer to 50.  I would advise that you take a Vitamin D3 supplement every second or third day to boost these levels.

Overview Notes: Dear Emily thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen.  You have a significant family history of chronic illness.  You have managed to decrease some of this risk by generally leading a good lifestyle.
Points to work on are sleep and decreasing sugar.  These are the two obvious drivers of ongoing moderate levels of background inflammation (your ultra sensitive CRP).  This in turn increases your cardiovascular risk for heart attacks and strokes.
Your vitamin D is normal but can be more optimal closer to 50.  I would advise that you take a Vitamin D3 supplement every second or third day to boost these levels.

Overview Notes: Dear Emily thank you for allowing us to help you identify any health concerns with this personalized screen.  You have a significant family history of chronic illness.  You have managed to decrease some of this risk by generally leading a good lifestyle.
Points to work on are sleep and decreasing sugar.  These are the two obvious drivers of ongoing moderate levels of background inflammation (your ultra sensitive CRP).  This in turn increases your cardiovascular risk for heart attacks and strokes.
Your vitamin D is normal but can be more optimal closer to 50.  I would advise that you take a Vitamin D3 supplement every second or third day to boost these levels.
It was a pleasure giving you feedback, we look forward to seeing you again next year!
