Men's Health Recommendations: PSA testing annually from age 40. Elevated PSA level doesn't necessarily indicate prostate cancer. Other conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate infections, can also lead to increased PSA levels
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Cholesterol levels: to try manage with lifestyle only. Take omega 3 supplements 2g daily. Repeat blood after 3 months. Increased triglycerides can be caused by too many refined carbohydrates in the diet so try to eliminate refined carbohydrates, exercise more frequently, increase fiber in your diet and lose some abdominal weight.

Clinical Recommendations: -Continue annual screening. Monitor your cholesterol levels bi-annually.
Men's Health Recommendations: PSA testing annually from age 40. Elevated PSA level doesn't necessarily indicate prostate cancer. Other conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate infections, can also lead to increased PSA levels
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Cholesterol levels: to try manage with lifestyle only. Take omega 3 supplements 2g daily. Repeat blood after 3 months. Increased triglycerides can be caused by too many refined carbohydrates in the diet so try to eliminate refined carbohydrates, exercise more frequently, increase fiber in your diet and lose some abdominal weight.

Clinical Recommendations: 
Men's Health Recommendations: PSA testing annually from age 40. Elevated PSA level doesn't necessarily indicate prostate cancer. Other conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate infections, can also lead to increased PSA levels
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Cholesterol levels: to try manage with lifestyle only. Take omega 3 supplements 2g daily. Repeat blood after 3 months. Increased triglycerides can be caused by too many refined carbohydrates in the diet so try to eliminate refined carbohydrates, exercise more frequently, increase fiber in your diet and lose some abdominal weight.
