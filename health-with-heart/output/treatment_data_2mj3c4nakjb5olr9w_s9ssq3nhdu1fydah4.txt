Comment Value: Marc, overall you seem to be in very good health! I commend you on being a non smoker, drinking minimal alcohol and frequently exercising, as this greatly contributes to your overall health. As discussed, your diet is generally good with the exception of the occasional skipped breakfast and unhealthy canteen choices. I think that optimising your vitamin D level is very important. This is not only important for bone health but for over a 100 different processes in your body. Vitamin D functions like a hormone and is important for general wellbeing, cognitive function, preventing certain cancers, reducing inflammation and the risk of autoimmune diseases. Your ultra sensitive CRP value was raised and can be a marker for heart disease risk but could also be due to a recent cold/flu. I recommend you follow an anti inflammatory diet, supplement with Omega 3 and then repeat the test when you are well (no cold/flu). Thank you for doing your medical with us!
