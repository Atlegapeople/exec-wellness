Comment Value: - Uric acid is raised: reduce purine rich foods (red or organ meats, shellfish, legumes), avoid sugar, limit alcohol intake & drink more water. Repeat in 3 months.
- Vitamin D level is suboptimal at 20.7 ng/ml. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 daily and repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml. Vitamin D is essential for bone and immune health as well as mood and hormone balance.
- Homocysteine level  is normal but above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare or Solal’s Homocysteine lowering formula. Repeat level in 6 months.
- hsCRP is raised - This puts you at high risk for cardiovascular disease, however, if you have had an infection in the past couple of weeks or when the bloods were taken this could have increased the level up. Stress also plays a role. Please repeat in 6 weeks.
