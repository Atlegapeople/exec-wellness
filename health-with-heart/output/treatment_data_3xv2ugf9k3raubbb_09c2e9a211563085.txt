Comment Value: 1. FBC had slightly low neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) which can occur after recent exposure to a virus/bacteria. There is no need to repeat this test.
2. The eGFR (filtration of the kidneys) was slightly low. This is a commonly seen when a person has fasted (as you were at time of sample collection). The test may be repeated in 3 months (when you are well hydrated) to ensure the kidneys are functioning well.
3. Total cholesterol was slightly increased at 5 mmol/L (0.1 mmol/L above the upper limit). This can be lowered by reducing animal product consumption and taking supplements like Niacin, Rychol and Omega 3. The test may be repeated in a year to monitor your cholesterol.
Please note that the abovementioned deviations in the biochemical results were very slight and does not mean you are ill.

Comment Value: Worries about work when stressed with tenders/pitches. This doesn't last long. She deals with it by being open with her team leader and sharing responsibility. Stress is usually positive motivator; it sometimes has a negative effect on her. Felt worried once to twice in the past 2 weeks, which resolved after work complete.

Comment Value: Has endometriosis, on Visanne. She would like to fall pregnant next year but is not currently trying to conceive. Concerned about the Endometriosis and Visanne affecting her fertility. 

She did a mammogram to screen for breast problems, but did not have (and still does not have) breast symptoms. The mammogram in 2021 showed a fibroadenoma, she was advised to f/u in a year. Repeat mammogram in 2022 showed no change in the fibroadenoma. She opted to do a biopsy (to reassure herself), biopsy normal. It was advised she follow up a year later for repeat mammogram.
