Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: Your Cholesterol levels were high on your bloods. This can be a combination of both genetic & lifestyle factors. We discussed starting a chronic medication (statin), but we will give it 3-4 months first to make some lifestyle changes. This will hopefully make an impact on lowering these levels. We will repeat blood levels after this time. We will also review your Urate levels to see if they improve with reduced alcohol and improved diet. Your Vit D levels were also low. This we can supplement and repeat levels on your next blood work.
