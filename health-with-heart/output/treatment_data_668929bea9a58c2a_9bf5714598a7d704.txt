Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Leucopaenia (low white cell count) with neutropaenia noted on full blood count - possible causes include a viral infection, medication induced (neomercazole) or immune mediated. You mention that you have had a bone marrow aspirate done and that they think it is immune mediated.
2. Your Vit D level is within normal but suboptimal at  35 ng/ml. Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu daily & recheck your level in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. Vit D is essential for bone, immune health, mood and hormone balance, amongst other functions. 
3. Your homocysteine (marker for autoimmune, heart and other chronic diseases) is normal but above optimal at 9.3 umol/l. We can bring this down by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Metagenics MethylCare (Wellness Warehouse/Faithful to Nature) & recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.

Overview Notes: Elizabeth overall you seem to be in good health. You have an overactive thyroid and history of a pituitary adenoma but currently this seems to be well managed under the care of your endocrinologist and neurologist. It was a pleasure to do your medical today, and I look forward to seeing you again next year. I wish you a wonderful second half of 2022.
