Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Low Vitamin D levels at 14 ng/ml. Optimal Vit D levels are 50-60 ng/ml. Supplement with 50 000 IU Vit D3 weekly for at least 3 months. Levels can be repeated after this period.
2. HS CRP was high and may be due to underlying inflammation or infection. Insulin resistance can contribute.
3. High cholesterol. Levels may reduce by limiting refined carbohydrates/sugar, trans fats and animal product consumption, and by supplementing with Omega 3 and Niacin. Please consider seeing a Dietician. The test can be repeated in 6 months after lifestyle adjustments have been made.
4. Fasting insulin levels are high. This means you are insulin resistant (a precursor for Diabetes).  This is still reversible with lifestyle adjustments! Please see a Dietician.
5. Cortisol is low and may be due to recent corticosteroid use or other factors. Repeat testing in 8 weeks is advised.
