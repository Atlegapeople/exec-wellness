Comment Value: You have a very fit and active lifestyle which has countless benefits. As a result you are generally very healthy.
You seem to be on top of your blood pressure and cholesterol. 
I think that you need to increase water intake and drink less caffeine containing drinks, aim for 1 to 2 cups a day maximum. You should also monitor your PSA, heart beat and kidney function in the next 12 months. 
It was a pleasure to meet you and I wish you many years of good health.
