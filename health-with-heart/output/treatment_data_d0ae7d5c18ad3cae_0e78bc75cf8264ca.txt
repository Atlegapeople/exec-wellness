MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Lee Bromfield
Report Date: 2025-02-10
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Clinically you examine well. Your repeat blood pressure was within a normal range: 115/78. With sun exposure during exercise - mole mapping is recommended. Especially if you notice any changes in skin lesions. Otherwise there is no current concern. Your BMI is within a healthy range.
Men's Health Recommendations: Your PSA levels (prostate screening marker) were normal on your blood work and you report no urinary symptoms. As you get older, regular screening, is important for detecting any irregularities & early intervention. I am glad there is no family history of concern.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, you have a good baseline with no current chronic conditions. There were a few areas we flagged for monitoring and improvement. We discussed reducing alcohol consumption, as well as your strong family history of cardiac disease. Maintaining healthy lifestyle habits and avoiding substances will help reduce future risks. We discussed aiming for balance throughout the year.

We can review your blood work next year to compare levels, or sooner if needed.

Wishing you a great year ahead—keep up the healthy habits!

Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: There were signs of dehydration on your blood work. This is in keeping with your history of running a marathon the weekend before the bloods were taken as well as being fasting when the sample was taken. This may also account for the raised inflammatory marker (hs-CRP) as well as the homocysteine marker. 
Homocysteine is a risk for marker for atherosclerosis. Given your family history I recommend repeating this level with you next blood work (annual). We can monitor and for now continue a good diet of leafy green vegetables.
Otherwise there was nothing noted of current concern.

Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Lebo Cindi
Clinical Recommendations: Clinically you examine well. Your repeat blood pressure was within a normal range: 115/78. With sun exposure during exercise - mole mapping is recommended. Especially if you notice any changes in skin lesions. Otherwise there is no current concern. Your BMI is within a healthy range.
Men's Health Recommendations: Your PSA levels (prostate screening marker) were normal on your blood work and you report no urinary symptoms. As you get older, regular screening, is important for detecting any irregularities & early intervention. I am glad there is no family history of concern.
Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: Overall, you have a good baseline with no current chronic conditions. There were a few areas we flagged for monitoring and improvement. We discussed reducing alcohol consumption, as well as your strong family history of cardiac disease. Maintaining healthy lifestyle habits and avoiding substances will help reduce future risks. We discussed aiming for balance throughout the year.
