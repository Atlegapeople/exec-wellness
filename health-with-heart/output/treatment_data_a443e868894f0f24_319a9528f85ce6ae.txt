Women's Health Recommendations: 
Overview Notes: The main concern identified today Bhuti is that your fasting insulin is high. Try to eliminate all sugars and refined carbohydrates, exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and aim to lose 10% of your body weight. I would encourage you to give this 3 to 4 months to work and then you should recheck the levels and follow up. It was a pleasure to do your medical today and I wish you a happy and healthy year further.
