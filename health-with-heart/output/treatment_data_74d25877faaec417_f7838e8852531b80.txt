Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. Homocysteine level within normal range but above optimal. Supplement with "Phytomulti" ot other activated B vitamins. An optimal level is around 7umol/l.
2. Mildly raised AST liver enzyme. This can be due to substances such as alcohol or medications. Reduce alcohol intake and supplement with milk thistle to support the liver.
3. Raised total and LDL cholesterol. The level seems to have been roughly the same over the last few years. Try to eat a healthy Mediterranean style diet, eliminate processed foods as much as possible, reduce alcohol consumption and continue to exercise. Monitor the levels annually.
4. Low vitamin D levels - supplement with vitamin D 5000iu daily and try to spend a bit of time outdoors in the sun. Recheck your level in 4 to 6 months aiming for a level of 50 to 80ng/ml.
5. Low DHEA level - you mention that you were previously diagnosed with ‘adrenal fatigue’ and took DHEA. I would recommend that you restart taking DHEA to support your adrenal response to stress.

Comment Key: LifestyleRecommendation
Comment Value: You have had major sleep issues since your late 20’s which you have determined is mostly stress related. You have investigated it through the sleep clinic and tried numerous sleep tablets. I would advise you to try and have no screens an hour before bedtime and do some deep breathing or mindfulness consistently every night. Develop a sleep routine that helps you unwind and “shelve” your stress as much as possible until the next day.

Overview Notes: Renzi it was a pleasure to do your medical today. Overall you seem to be fairly healthy however we did discuss a few things that we identified in your blood results and some supplements that could benefit you. Please also keep in mind the effect that stress can have on your health, sleep and quality of life and try to find things that you can do everyday to dampen down your stress response. It’s great that you find golf so therapeutic on the weekends but I encourage you to bring something into your daily life that gives you the same feeling!
