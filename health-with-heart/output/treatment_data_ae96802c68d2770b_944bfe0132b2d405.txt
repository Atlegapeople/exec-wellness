MEDICAL RECORDS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
Employee: Sandiswa Magama
Report Date: 2024-01-29
Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: You examine clinically well. Regular self breast examinations are recommended. If you detect any irregularities to consult your GP for further investigation. Your Hearing Test showed a mild reduction in the one area - they recommend a full audiogram to be done. The report is attached.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular Pap smear screening is important in order to detect any irregularities early. I am glad that your last one was normal. You are due for a repeat test - this can be booked with your GP or Gynae.
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline with no current concerns. There were a few areas that we identified for optimisation - diet and exercise being two of them. Making these lifestyle changes can be hard but so worth it in the long run!

We are here to support your health in whatever way we can. We can follow-up you up at the practice for your repeat Pap Smear. 

Hope it has been a good start to the year.

Doctor: Jessica Koen
Nurse: Rebecca Mogale
Clinical Recommendations: You examine clinically well. Regular self breast examinations are recommended. If you detect any irregularities to consult your GP for further investigation. Your Hearing Test showed a mild reduction in the one area - they recommend a full audiogram to be done. The report is attached.
Men's Health Recommendations: 
Women's Health Recommendations: Regular Pap smear screening is important in order to detect any irregularities early. I am glad that your last one was normal. You are due for a repeat test - this can be booked with your GP or Gynae.
Overview Notes: Overall you have a good baseline with no current concerns. There were a few areas that we identified for optimisation - diet and exercise being two of them. Making these lifestyle changes can be hard but so worth it in the long run!

We are here to support your health in whatever way we can. We can follow-up you up at the practice for your repeat Pap Smear. 

Hope it has been a good start to the year. 

Warm regards,
Dr Jess Koen
