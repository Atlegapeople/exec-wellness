Comment Value: Adriaan, it was a pleasure meeting you and having the opportunity to look at how we can optimise your health.
You are training very hard for the Cycle Tour coming up - all the best! Remember your body needs the rest to recuperate and perform adequately. We did these tests when you were in an intense part of your training, before you had a rest period - so I think we need to take that into consideration.
You can consult with your GP to have the above tests done or you can come to the Wellness Centre and see one of our GP's. There is also a dietician available at the Wellness Centre.
You mentioned that you were worried about your bowel habits and colon. If you have done the above suggestions and your problems still persist - I would suggest that you see a gastroenterologist.
Look after yourself, hope 2022 is a healthy year for you and your family!
