Comment Value: Your GGT liver enzyme was raised. This is possibly due to a high alcohol consumption and definitely something we recommend cutting down on to avoid permanent damage/ failure. Your cholesterol was also raised. Making some of the lifestyle changes we discussed (diet/ exercise) will help reduce this level. We can repeat bloods in 3-4 months and review.
