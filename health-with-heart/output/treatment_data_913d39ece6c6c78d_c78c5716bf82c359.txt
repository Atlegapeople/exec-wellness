Comment Value: 1.Vit D - Please supplement with vit D3 5000iu and repeat in 3/12. Aim for a level of 50 - 80 ng/ml. 
2. Total cholesterol/LDL - If other cardiovascular risk markers are raised we may decide to treat this more aggressively. Follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh veggies and decrease sugar and refined carbs. Regular exercise 3-5x/week for 30 min is also important. Supplements that may help to lower cholesterol include Omega 3, Rhychol, Niacin 100 mg&Glucochol22. Repeat levels in 6/12.
3.Homocysteine - We would like to bring this down by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. Please take Metagenics MethylCare (Wellness Warehouse/Faithful to Nature) & recheck the level in 3 months. Aim for <7 umol/l.
4. Fasting sugar: Please ensure that you are exercising frequently and reduce sugar&refined carbohydrates to a minimum. I would suggest repeating this to confirm the level.
