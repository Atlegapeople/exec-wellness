Comment Value: - Vitamin D level is suboptimal. Please supplement with Vitamin D3 1000iu daily & repeat in 3 months. Aim for a level of 50-80ng/ml.
- Kidney function: eGFR was slightly reduced. Could have been due to dehydration. Repeat in 3 months.
- Lower cholesterol by limiting saturated & trans fats, adding healthy fats i.e. omega 3 fatty acids, eating more plant-based foods & replacing refined carbs with those high in fibre. Supplementing with Rychol may assist to lower cholesterol.
- Homocysteine level is above the optimal level which is <7umol/l. Optimize by supplementing with methylated B vitamins. We recommend Metagenics MethylCare. Repeat level in 6 months.
- Raised fasting insulin indicates insulin resistance. It is important to reduce your refined carbohydrate & sugar intake as well as incorporate regular exercise into your lifestyle (3-5 times a week for 30-60 minutes). Recommend a repeat in 6 weeks. Supplement with Insumax Q to assist.
