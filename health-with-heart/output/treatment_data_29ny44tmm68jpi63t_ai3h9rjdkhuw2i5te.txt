Comment Value: Thank you for doing your medical with us again this year. It's clear that your physical wellbeing is a priority for you. This shows in your commitment to physical exercise, mental strength and healthy food and supplement choices. Outside of the external and uncontrollable stressors that have affected you in the last few years, I think your biggest health risk factor is the stress of the work place and your incredible drive to add value. Whilst this is certainly an asset to business and the gifts that you bring to the world, I urge you to try to create more inward time for quiet, reflection and calm in the coming year. Please also remember to follow up on your blood pressure.

This shows in your commitment to physical exercise, mental strength and healthy food and supplement choices. Outside of the external and uncontrollable stressors that have affected you in the last few years, I think your biggest health risk factor is the stress of the work place and your incredible drive to add value. Whilst this is certainly an asset to business and the gifts that you bring to the world, I urge you to try to create more inward time for quiet, reflection and calm in the coming year. Please also remember to follow up on your blood pressure.
