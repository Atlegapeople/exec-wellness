Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Vitamin D is very important for bone health, mood and cognition and is anti-inflammatory and protect against certain cancers. Your level is not low but is suboptimal. I recommend you supplement with D3 5000iu daily and aim for a level of 50 to 80ng/ml. Repeat the level in about 4 to 6 months and if optimal decrease to 1000iu daily

Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.

Overview Notes: Vitamin D is very important for bone health, mood and cognition and is anti-inflammatory and protect against certain cancers. Your level is not low but is suboptimal. I recommend you supplement with D3 5000iu daily and aim for a level of 50 to 80ng/ml. Repeat the level in about 4 to 6 months and if optimal decrease to 1000iu daily

Overview Notes: Sleep is very important for overall health. It is when the body repairs itself and detoxifies. Try to limit screen time for at least two hours before bed as the blue light inhibits melatonin, the sleep hormone. Also consider doing something relaxing before bedtime like having a bath with epsom salts and some camomile tea or 5 minutes of a sleep meditation.
