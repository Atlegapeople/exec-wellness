Overview Notes: Low Vit D levels
Comment Key: MedicalHistoryNote
Comment Value: Shalin you are in good health and have good lifestyle and dietary habits. I am only concerned about the ECG changes (often associated with hypertension)which should be checked by a cardiologist. He can also advise you about your cholesterol and statin dosing with better authority. Please make an appointment to see a cardiologist in the next month or two. You have a few moles which I pointed out, they appear normal but they need to be monitored by your GP or a dermatologist yearly. If you notice any changes, especially the one on your chest then you must tell your GP as soon as possible. Next year you will do your first prostate exam and blood test.
Your Vitamin D levels are very low and you need to supplement with Vitamin D3. Start with 5000iu a day or 5 x week until your levels go back to normal and then take a maintenance dose of 1000iu daily. Vitamin D is important for over 100 different functions in your body and restoring them will help with cognitive function, general well being and bone health to name a few.
I hope you found this medical useful and we look forward to seeing you again next year.
