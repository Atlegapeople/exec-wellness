Comment Key: LabTestRecommendation
Comment Value: 1. The ESR was slightly increased. This marker may increase with underlying chronic inflammation or infection. 
2. HS CRP (an inflammatory marker) was slightly raised which can be due to underlying inflammation/infection, but an increased waist circumference can contribute. Please make lifestyle changes as discussed.
3. Low Vitamin D levels. Take a good Vit D. supplement of at least 3500 IU a day and re-check levels in 4-6 months.
